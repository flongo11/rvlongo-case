## 💣 SIX SMOKING GUNS

### 1. No Grand Jury Indictment
Fifth Amendment bypassed via fabricated FBI Most Wanted status

### 2. Physical Impossibility  
FBI claims Mexico arrest Aug 29, 2005 while Francesco in Windsor jail with continuous phone records

### 3. PILLS vs PLANTS Document Fraud
Sentencing discussed 5,000 PILLS, documents changed to "over 1,000 PLANTS" to hide two-drug combination

### 4. February 14, 2006 Courtroom Betrayal
Judge Kovakovich orders "make an example," MARCO O'BRIAN blocks professional witnesses (Chief of Police, Lt. Hartman, Sgt. Rinaldi)

### 5. Professional Witness Suppression
Same pattern Tampa 2005 and Windsor 2021 - both attorneys blocked high-profile witnesses

### 6. THE KIJIJI STING (NEW EVIDENCE)
**Windsor Police actively hunted Francesco using his business ad BEFORE any complaint filed**

**Timeline:**
- May 2021: Francesco posts Kijiji ad for pool construction
- Fake customer contacts requesting quote
- Meeting arranged at Amherstburg property (City of Windsor owned)
- Officer present at fake meeting
- **3 DAYS LATER:** Same officer at Francesco's arrest
- **Inspector Karel DeGraaf** coordinated operation
- **2024:** DeGraaf promoted to Deputy Chief

**This is "Kijiji Killers" methodology (Millard/Smich, Tim Bosma murder 2013) used by police to target a citizen.**

**Proves PREMEDITATION, not reactive prosecution.**
