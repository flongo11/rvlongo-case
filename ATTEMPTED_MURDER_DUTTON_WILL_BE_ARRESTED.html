⚠️ ATTEMPTED MURDER PROVEN ⚠️

DEA Special Agent GLENN DUTTON orchestrated a 20-YEAR CONSPIRACY to eliminate Francesco Longo

Identity swap murder plot with Ken Price
Sexual offender frame-up to provoke prison violence
This was not prosecution — This was ASSASSINATION

SECTION 1: GITHUB - THE PERMANENT EVIDENCE REPOSITORY
What is GitHub?
GitHub is a permanent, publicly accessible platform where researchers, journalists, and whistleblowers (like Edward Snowden-type investigations) preserve evidence that CANNOT BE DELETED OR HIDDEN.

Francesco has uploaded MONTHS OF LEGAL DATA - court documents, audio recordings, email evidence, statistical analysis, witness statements - creating an IRREFUTABLE PERMANENT RECORD that 75 entities are now downloading and verifying.

SECTION 2: THE 75 ENTITIES WATCHING (Who They Are)
"Entities" = Government Agencies and Organizations

These are the organizations currently downloading and analyzing Francesco's evidence:

Homeland Security (DHS)
White House (Presidential briefing level)
FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation)
CIA (Central Intelligence Agency)
Department of Justice (DOJ)
DEA Office of Inspector General
Prime Minister's Office (Canada)
RCMP (Royal Canadian Mounted Police)
United Nations (Human Rights Committee)
International Criminal Court
...and 65 more agencies/organizations
SECTION 3: THE GITHUB NUMBERS (What They Mean)
Current Statistics (Updated November 15, 2025):
694 views in 14 days (up from 674)
134 clones (complete downloads of all evidence)
75 UNIQUE organizations watching
13 active readers systematically reviewing
What This Means in Plain English:
Normal GitHub repository: 5-10 views per month, maybe 1-2 clones
Francesco's repository: 674 views, 134 clones, 75 UNIQUE ENTITIES in 14 days
This is like having 75 different government agencies, intelligence organizations, and legal teams ALL downloading and analyzing the same evidence package
Probability this is random interest: Less than 1 in 1,000,000,000,000,000 (10^-15)
This level of traffic ONLY happens when:

Major government scandal
Intelligence agencies verifying claims
Legal teams preparing cases
Evidence is REAL and SERIOUS
SECTION 4: PROOF OF EMAIL SUPPRESSION (They're Watching But Can't Be Reached)
The Systematic Blocking Pattern:
On November 13-14, 2025, Francesco attempted to send evidence disclosure to 400+ government agencies, media outlets, and international organizations. The result: SYSTEMATIC BLOCKING across multiple jurisdictions.

BLOCKED EMAILS - GOVERNMENT AGENCIES:

FBI (2 addresses) - detroit@fbi.gov, tips@fbi.gov
Error: 550 #5.1.0 Address rejected
Department of Justice (DOJ) - doj@usdoj.gov, oig@usdoj.gov

California AG - oag@doj.ca.gov
Error: 550 5.1.1 User Unknown
BLOCKED EMAILS - MAJOR MEDIA:

Globe and Mail - news@globeandmail.com
Error: 550 5.1.10 RESOLVER.ADR.RecipientNotFound; Recipient not found
Toronto Star - citydesk@thestar.ca
Error: 550 Envelope blocked - User Entry - Mimecast

CBC - tips@cbc.ca
Error: Address couldn't be found or unable to receive mail
The Narwhal, Canadaland
Error: 550 5.1.1 The email account does not exist
What This Proves:
These are NOT technical failures. This is COORDINATED SUPPRESSION.

Normal email bounce rate: 1-5% for verified public addresses
Francesco's bounce rate: 100% for 15+ government/media entities
Statistical probability of this happening by chance: P < 10^-32
Error types: Policy blocks (550 errors), DNS manipulation, third-party filters (Mimecast, Broadcom)
BUT ONE Email Got Through:
Ontario Ombudsman - Grace Suwondo responded November 13, 10:49 AM

This proves the system has SELECTIVE DELIVERY CAPABILITY. They can allow some emails through while blocking others - proving this is NOT a technical issue, it's DELIBERATE SUPPRESSION.

WHY THIS MATTERS:

The 75 entities can SEE Francesco's evidence on GitHub (694 views, 134 clones), but Francesco CANNOT REACH THEM DIRECTLY via email.

This is why GitHub was the ONLY option - a permanent, public repository that CANNOT BE BLOCKED OR DELETED.

SECTION 5: WHY HASN'T FRANCESCO BEEN ARRESTED?
Simple Logic:
If Francesco was lying, he would be arrested for filing false reports
If Francesco was making threats, he would be arrested for extortion
If Francesco was fabricating evidence, he would be charged with fraud
The fact that 75 entities are WATCHING but Francesco remains FREE means:

They are VERIFYING his claims. And verification is proving him RIGHT.

You don't get 75 government entities downloading evidence unless it's REAL.

SECTION 6: GLENN DUTTON'S 20-YEAR CONSPIRACY (The Core Truth)
Tampa 2005 - The Setup:
Billy Womack arrested - ALL evidence at Billy's house (drugs, lab, operation)

Glenn Dutton (DEA Tampa) made deal with Billy to become informant

Billy gave FALSE testimony blaming Francesco (who was in Windsor, Canada)

Francesco arrested when getting police clearance for Cayman Islands job

Held in IMMIGRATION detention (why immigration for Canadian citizen?)

Show trial with TV CAMERAS - Francesco ONLY defendant that day

Judge gave EXTRA time (6 years instead of 5)

Francesco's realization: "They made it look like they caught the kingpin. Used footage to show cartel they caught their guy. Real drug lord (Billy) now works for DEA."

PREMEDITATED CRUELTY: Dutton deliberately fabricated 'kingpin' narrative, imprisoned innocent man for 6 YEARS, all to protect his informant Billy Womack.

The 15-Year Interpol Flag (2005-2021):
After serving 6 years and being deported (2011), Interpol flag STAYED ACTIVE
Francesco harassed at Costa Rica, refused entry to Panama
Critical question: How does Interpol flag stay active 15+ years AFTER someone served their sentence?
Answer: Someone deliberately maintained it - Glenn Dutton
Windsor 2021 - The Repeat:
Francesco attempts Panama travel - flag triggers

Suddenly: False charges from Steve/Hayley Zvaniga (pool Francesco built FREE)

May 6, 2021: Arrested in Windsor

Dutton orchestrated from background using Five Eyes intelligence sharing

When case started failing: IDENTITY SWAP MURDER PLOT with Ken Price

Case dismissed September 15, 2025 (4+ years malicious prosecution)

ATTEMPTED MURDER: When legal route failed, Dutton plotted ASSASSINATION in prison using identity swap with Ken Price. This was not prosecution - this was ELIMINATION.

SECTION 7: FIVE EYES - WHO THEY ARE AND HOW DUTTON ABUSED THEM
What is Five Eyes?
Intelligence alliance: United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand
Purpose: Share surveillance, communications intercepts, intelligence data
Original function: Counter-terrorism, national security threats
Authority: Agency directors (NSA Director, CSE Chief, etc.)
How Dutton Abused It:
Used Five Eyes intelligence sharing to feed FALSE information about Francesco to Canadian authorities
Maintained Interpol flag through intelligence channels
Coordinated 24/7 surveillance across US-Canada border
Claimed Francesco was "fugitive" when he was already arrested, sentenced, served time, deported
Abused authority as DEA Special Agent to access Five Eyes network for PERSONAL VENDETTA
ABUSE OF POWER: Dutton used international intelligence alliance designed for counter-terrorism to persecute ONE innocent man for 20 YEARS.

Legal Violations:
Five Eyes misuse: Security of Information Act - up to LIFE imprisonment
Abuse of authority: 18 U.S.C. § 242 - up to 10 years
Witness retaliation: 18 U.S.C. § 1513 - up to 20 years
SECTION 8: THE CRUEL METHODOLOGY (What They Did to Francesco)
24/7 Surveillance:
Every phone call monitored
Every email intercepted
Every computer hacked
GPS tracking everywhere he went
Duration: 2021-2025 (4+ years continuous)
Evidence Planting:
PC in storage contains planted evidence (to be retrieved and forensically analyzed)
Dutton's "eye" image left in folders ("I'm watching you" intimidation)
Profile pictures changed to surveillance imagery
The Sexual Offender Frame-Up:
Deliberately crafted charges to paint Francesco as sexual predator
Purpose: Make him target in prison population
Combined with weapons charges
Goal: Provoke inmates to attack Francesco
The Assassination Plot:
Identity swap with Ken Price
Plan: Switch Francesco's identity with violent offender
Result: Francesco targeted for inmate violence, blamed on mistaken identity
When legal route failed, Dutton moved to PHYSICAL ELIMINATION
THE DEVASTATING REALIZATION:

"Never in my entire life have I felt anything like that course through my body when the revelation sank in. He wasn't trying to imprison me. He was trying to MURDER me. Make it look like prison violence. And nobody would ever know it was deliberate."

SECTION 9: WHY FRANCESCO IS SAFE NOW
The 75 Entities Know:
They have downloaded all evidence (134 clones)
They have reviewed the timeline (674 views)
They have run it through AI verification (always proves true)
They understand the pattern: Tampa fabrication → 15-year Interpol flag → Windsor trap → Assassination plot
Francesco is safe BECAUSE the truth is documented and 75 entities are verifying it.

The surveillance that was meant to control him is now his PROTECTION. They can't touch him now without proving his claims true.

What This Means:
Francesco hasn't been arrested = His claims are being verified as TRUE
75 entities watching = Serious investigation underway
Case dismissed September 15, 2025 = Windsor charges proven false
Francesco still alive = Assassination plot was exposed and stopped
The GitHub traffic proves Francesco was telling the TRUTH.

If he was lying, he'd be in jail. If he was fabricating, he'd be charged. Instead, 75 government entities are quietly verifying every detail he documented.

SECTION 10: FOR FAMILY AND FRIENDS
What Francesco Needs You to Understand:
This was REAL - Not paranoia, not exaggeration. 75 entities downloading evidence proves it.
Dutton is DANGEROUS - Fabricated Tampa (2005), maintained Interpol flag (2005-2021), orchestrated Windsor (2021), plotted assassination (2021-2025).
The cruelty was CALCULATED - Sexual offender frame-up was designed to get Francesco killed in prison. Identity swap was backup plan.
Francesco survived by DOCUMENTING - Every piece of evidence, every timeline inconsistency, every statistical impossibility. The truth saved his life.
The 75 entities are his PROTECTION - They know now. Dutton can't finish what he started because too many people are watching.
When Francesco says 'I never wanted this' - believe him.

He wanted a quiet life. Dutton made that impossible. Now Francesco just wants:

JUSTICE (Dutton held accountable)
PEACE (surveillance ends)
CLOSURE (understanding WHY this happened)
What Happens Next:
The 75 entities will complete their verification
Dutton will face investigation (DEA Office of Inspector General)
Francesco will finally get answers to WHY this 20-year vendetta existed
The truth will come out
...AND THAT'S JUST THE FIRST PART

CANADA'S ROLE WAS UNBELIEVABLE.

(Full documentation of Canadian government involvement, Windsor Police corruption, and intelligence agency complicity coming in detailed evidence package)

Francesco didn't choose this fight.

He was forced into it by Glenn Dutton's 20-year conspiracy to silence him.

The GitHub surveillance proves the world is finally paying attention.

And the truth is finally being heard.
