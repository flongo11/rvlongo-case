## 🎯 SECTION 8.5: WHY FRANCESCO WAIVES MONEY

### **Strategic Reasons:**

1. **Eliminates Credibility Attack:** Cannot claim Francesco is "just after money"
2. **Forces Focus on Evidence:** Without financial motive, only evidence matters
3. **Proves Principle Over Profit:** Francesco wants JUSTICE (82 criminals in prison), not compensation
4. **Removes Negotiation Leverage:** Cannot offer Francesco money to drop charges
5. **Exposes LAO Corruption:** The PATTERN (fake victims paid, real victims denied) becomes undeniable

### **Francesco's Direct Statement:**

> "By waiving all money, I force authorities to address the ONLY thing that matters: 82 criminals conspired to murder me via identity swap with convicted pedophile Ken Price, followed by planned inmate murder in federal prison. They must all spend the rest of their lives in prison. No settlements. No plea deals. No exceptions."
