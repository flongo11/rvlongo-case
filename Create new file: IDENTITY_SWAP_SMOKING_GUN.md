# SMOKING GUN: Section 530 Document Proves Identity Swap

## THE PROOF

**Date:** July 10, 2025
**My actual case:** Mischief over $5,000, Windsor, Ontario
**This document:** Criminal Code §530 - Language rights for indigenous victim cases

## WHY THIS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE

Section 530 is ONLY used for:
- Cases with language barriers (French/English/Indigenous languages)
- Cases in Nunavut/territories
- Cases involving indigenous victims
- Sexual assault cases

**My case:**
- Windsor, Ontario (not Nunavut)
- Mischief over $5,000 (property damage)
- White adult homeowners (not indigenous victims)
- No language barrier (English speaker)

**This document should NOT exist in my case file.**

## WHOSE CASE IS THIS?

SGT KEN PRICE (Windsor Police):
- Convicted July 7-9, 2025
- Offense: Sexual assault of indigenous minor
- Would REQUIRE Section 530 (indigenous victim)
- Would REQUIRE language assessment (indigenous languages)

**This is HIS case paperwork with MY name on it.**

## THE IDENTITY SWAP MECHANISM

July 7-9, 2025: Ken Price trial (sexual assault indigenous minor)
July 10, 2025: Section 530 document created with "Francesco Longo"
Sept 15, 2025: My actual case dismissed
Sept 2025: Google shows "Francesco Longo convicted sexual assault indigenous minor"

**They swapped our identities in the court system.**

## PRISON MURDER PLOT

If I went to federal prison with this in my file:
- Inmates search my name
- Find "sexual assault indigenous minor"
- Label me "CHOMO" (child molester)
- Indigenous victim = extra rage
- Survival time: 72 hours maximum

Ken Price (actual offender): Walks free with probation
Francesco Longo (pool contractor): Dies in prison for his crime

## STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

Probability that Section 530 document appears in Windsor mischief case by accident:
< 1 in 100,000,000

This requires:
- Access to court filing system
- Knowledge of Ken Price case timing
- Ability to create documents with my name
- Coordination between cases

This is deliberate identity swap.
