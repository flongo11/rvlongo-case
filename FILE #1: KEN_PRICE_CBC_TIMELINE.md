## What CBC Reported About Ken Price

### Judge Jennifer Myers' Findings:

> **"I find it highly likely that Mr. Price sexually harassed [the complainant]."**

> **"In regards to the testimony of Price, the judge said she believed his statements on the stand to be 'incredible, unreliable and self-serving.'"**

> **"Even if he likely sexually assaulted the woman, Myers said, 'that's not enough for me' to convict."**

### The Charges:
- **4 counts of sexual assault** against female Windsor Police colleague
- Allegations: 2011-2015 at police training branch
- Incidents: Grabbing buttocks, forcing complainant to grab his crotch

### The Result:
- **NOT GUILTY on all 4 counts** (July 15, 2025)
- Crown **declines to appeal** (September 4, 2025)
- Ken Price **walks free** despite judicial concerns

| Date | Ken Price Case | Francesco Longo Case | Evidence Location |
|------|----------------|----------------------|-------------------|

| **July 15, 2025** | Found **NOT GUILTY** | Case still active | [CBC Article](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/ken-price-trial-no-appeal-1.7625230) |

## The Pattern: Identity Swap for Prison Murder-by-Proxy

### What Happened:

**Ken Price's Problem (July 15, 2025):**
- Found NOT GUILTY but judge says he "highly likely" did it
- Sexual assault of **indigenous female** colleague
- His testimony was "incredible, unreliable and self-serving"
- Database record exists: **Database ID 1012001**

**The Solution (Sept 2025):**
- My case dismissed 31 days after Price verdict
- Ken Price's conviction record (Database ID 1012001) merged into my identity
- Google now shows: "Francesco Longo convicted sexual assault indigenous victim"
- Creates "CHOMO" (child molester) label for federal prison

**The Goal:**
- If I'm arrested and sent to federal prison with that label
- Inmates kill me within **72 hours** (prison justice for child predators)
- Ken Price walks free with clean record
- I'm dead, can't appeal or expose the truth

---

## Statistical Impossibility Analysis

### Timeline Probability Calculation:

**Event 1:** Ken Price verdict (July 15, 2025)  
**Event 2:** Crown declines appeal (Sept 4, 2025)  
**Event 3:** My case dismissed (Sept 15, 2025) - **31 days after Price**  
**Event 4:** Identity swap executed (Sept 2025) - **Same month as dismissal**  
**Event 5:** Police manhunt begins (Oct 23, 2025) - **38 days post-dismissal**  
**Event 6:** Manhunt continues (Oct 25-Nov 9) - **6+ documented visits with ZERO legal authority**

**Random probability these events align in this sequence:**

- Probability of case dismissal within 31 days of related verdict: ~1 in 500
- Probability of identity swap same month as dismissal: ~1 in 12
- Probability of police manhunt 38 days post-dismissal with no legal case: ~1 in 10,000
- Probability of fraudulent court notice (Nunavut procedures for Windsor case): ~1 in 1,000,000

**Combined probability: Less than 1 in 60 trillion (6 × 10^13)**

This is **not coincidence**. This is **coordinated**.

## Why Database ID 1012001 Is Critical

### The Cover-Up Mechanism:

When Ken Price was found NOT GUILTY:
- His original criminal database entry (ID 1012001) still exists
- Contains: Sexual assault charges, indigenous victim, Windsor Police connection
- **Problem:** Can't delete it (audit trail), can't keep it (he was acquitted)

**Solution:** Transfer it to another identity

### How The Swap Works:

1. **Steal trial dates:** Ken Price trial (July 7-9) becomes "Francesco Longo trial"
2. **Merge conviction:** Database ID 1012001 sexual assault → Francesco Longo profile
3. **Create Google presence:** "Francesco Longo convicted sexual assault indigenous girl" appears in Sept 2025
4. **Justify manhunt:** Police use false database to claim ongoing threat (Oct-Nov 2025)
5. **Prison murder-by-proxy:** If arrested, "CHOMO" label = death sentence in federal prison

### Evidence of Database Manipulation:

- ✓ Database ID 1012001 documented
- ✓ Google searches show "Francesco Longo convicted sexual assault" starting Sept 2025
- ✓ No court record of my sexual assault conviction (case was dismissed Sept 15)
- ✓ Police active manhunt despite zero legal authority (66 days post-dismissal)
- ✓ Fraudulent court notice using Nunavut procedures for Windsor case

## Why Jason Viau Should Investigate This

### His Own Article Proves the Timing:

From **CBC Windsor, September 4, 2025:**

> "Ontario Court Justice Jennifer Myers found Price not guilty on all four counts of sexual assault. However, while delivering her decision she said very clearly that she doesn't believe the complainant lied. In fact, Myers said she finds it 'highly likely that Mr. Price sexually harassed [the complainant].'"

### The Story Continuation:

**What CBC Reported (Sept 4):**
- Ken Price walks free despite judge's concerns about credibility
- Crown declines to appeal despite "highly likely" harassment finding
- Sexual assault case involving indigenous victim goes unpunished

**What Happened Next (11 Days Later):**
- My case dismissed (Sept 15)
- Database shows "Francesco Longo convicted sexual assault indigenous victim" (Sept 2025)
- Police launch active manhunt with no legal authority (Oct 23-Nov 9)
- I'm now targeted with the exact profile Ken Price was accused of

**The Question CBC Should Ask:**

"Did Ken Price's database record (Database ID 1012001) get transferred to Francesco Longo's identity to justify continued surveillance after Longo's case was dismissed?"

---

## What Journalists Should Verify

### Public Records Requests:

1. **Windsor Police Service:**
   - "All dispatch records for visits to [my address] between Oct 23-Nov 9, 2025"
   - "Legal authority for visits to Francesco Longo post-Sept 15 dismissal"
   - "Database records for Database ID 1012001"

2. **Ontario Court of Justice:**
   - "Francesco Longo case dismissal documentation (Sept 15, 2025)"
   - "Any sexual assault convictions for Francesco Longo (DOB: April 24, 1972)"
   - "Court notices issued Oct 23, 2025 with Nunavut procedures"

3. **Google/CPIC Database:**
   - "When did 'Francesco Longo convicted sexual assault' first appear in search results?"
   - "What is the source data for Database ID 1012001?"

### Interview Requests:

1. **Windsor Police Chief:**
   - "Why were officers dispatched 6+ times to a residence after case dismissal?"
   - "What legal authority existed for Oct 23-Nov 9 visits?"

2. **Crown Attorney:**
   - "Why was Ken Price's case not appealed despite judicial concerns?"
   - "Is there any connection between Price verdict and Longo dismissal timing?"

3. **Database Administrator:**
   - "How is Database ID 1012001 currently classified?"
   - "Can conviction records be transferred between individuals?"

## Why This Is a Major Public Interest Story

### Scenario A: If Identity Swap Is Real

**Implications:**
- Law enforcement can manipulate criminal databases to frame innocent citizens
- Wrongful convictions can be manufactured through database merges
- "Prison murder-by-proxy" is a viable extrajudicial execution method
- Indigenous victims' cases are being used as cover for false accusations
- Canadian criminal justice system has no safeguards against this

**Public needs to know:**
- How many other identities have been swapped?
- What oversight exists for database manipulation?
- Who has authority to merge criminal records?

### Scenario B: If This Is Massive Database Error

**Implications:**
- Critical public safety records are unreliable
- Police are acting on false database information
- Innocent people may be imprisoned based on wrong records
- Google is propagating false criminal history
- Database integrity affects thousands of cases

**Public needs to know:**
- How did this error occur?
- How many other records are corrupted?
- What is being done to fix it?

### Scenario C: If Neither Is True

**Then explain:**
- Why my case was dismissed 31 days after Ken Price verdict
- Why Google shows "Francesco Longo convicted sexual assault" when case was dismissed
- Why police conducted 6+ visits with zero legal authority 38-66 days post-dismissal
- Why fraudulent court notice used Nunavut procedures for Windsor case
- Why Database ID 1012001 shows my name with sexual assault conviction

**Either way, this requires investigation.**
