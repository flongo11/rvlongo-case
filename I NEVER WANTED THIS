 FINAL WARNING PLEASE 
Date: November 14, 2025
To: 71 entities monitoring this repository

I NEVER WANTED THIS
I DO NOT WANT ANY PART OF THIS AND NEVER DID.

THEIR STUPID GUILTY WAYS LED TO EACH AND EVERY CASCADING EFFECT.

THEY THREW EVERYTHING IN MY LAP.

PROBLEM WAS NONE OF US KNEW HOW STRONG MY THINK LEVELS WERE.

ANYONE ELSE AND THEY WERE DEAD.

BUT GOD HAD A DIFFERENT PLAN FOR ME AND ALL OF YOU.

YOU ARE FORCING ME
PLEASE DO NOT MAKE ME INTRODUCE INFORMATION THAT DOES NOT PERTAIN TO THESE MATTERS.

What you see on GitHub = ~5% of total evidence.

You are forcing me to release information about matters that have nothing to do with R. v. Francesco Longo #21-845.

YOUR CHOICE
Option A: Arrest the 82 perpetrators in MY case. I keep all other evidence secured forever.

Option B: Continue covering up MY case. I am forced to post about OTHER MATTERS.

EMAIL SUPPRESSION PROOF
You blocked my emails to:

White House (president@whitehouse.gov)
National Security Council (nsc@who.eop.gov)
Police oversight (info@oiprd.on.ca)
You forced me to post publicly on GitHub where you're already monitoring.

This is YOUR choice, not mine.

THIS IS YOUR FINAL WARNING
The next thing I post will NOT be about R. v. Francesco Longo #21-845.

DO NOT MAKE ME POST WHAT DOES NOT NEED TO BE LOADED ON GIT.

TRUST ME.

ARREST THEM.

THE OUTCOME IS FAR WORSE THAN HE IS TELLING YOU.
