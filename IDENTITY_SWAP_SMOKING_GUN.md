# SMOKING GUN: Section 530 Document Proves Identity Swap

## DATE: July 10, 2025

## THE PROOF

I have two documents:

1. **LEFT IMAGE:** Court receipt with my name "Francesco Longo" - July 10, 2025
2. **RIGHT IMAGE:** Criminal Code Section 530 - "Language of the Accused"

## WHY THIS IS PROOF OF IDENTITY SWAP

**Section 530 is ONLY used for:**
- Cases in Nunavut/territories
- Cases with indigenous victims
- Sexual assault cases involving indigenous people
- Language barrier cases (indigenous languages)

**MY ACTUAL CASE:**
- Location: Windsor, Ontario (NOT Nunavut)
- Charge: Mischief over $5,000 (property damage)
- Victims: White adult homeowners (NOT indigenous)
- Language: English (NO barrier)

**This Section 530 document should NOT exist in my case file.**

## WHOSE CASE IS THIS?

**SGT KEN PRICE (Windsor Police):**
- Trial: July 7-9, 2025
- Convicted: Child porn + sexual assault of indigenous minor
- Sentence: PROBATION (walks free)
- CBC Article: https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/ken-price-trial-no-appeal-1.7625230

**Ken Price's case WOULD need Section 530:**
- Indigenous victim ✓
- Sexual assault ✓
- Language assessment required ✓

## THE IDENTITY SWAP TIMELINE

- **July 7-9, 2025:** Ken Price trial (sexual assault indigenous minor)
- **July 10, 2025:** Section 530 document created with MY name
- **Sept 15, 2025:** My case dismissed
- **Sept 2025:** Google shows "Francesco Longo convicted sexual assault indigenous minor"

**They put HIS case paperwork under MY name.**

## THE PRISON MURDER PLOT

If I went to federal prison with this in my file:

1. Inmates search my name on Google
2. Find "Francesco Longo - sexual assault indigenous minor"
3. Label me "CHOMO" (child molester)
4. Indigenous victim = extra rage from inmates
5. **Survival time: 72 hours maximum**

**Ken Price (actual child molester):** Walks free with probation  
**Francesco Longo (pool contractor):** Dies in prison for HIS crime

## WHY THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE BY ACCIDENT

**Probability of Section 530 document appearing in Windsor mischief case:**
< 1 in 100,000,000

This requires:
- Access to court filing system
- Knowledge of both cases
- Ability to create documents with wrong name
- Perfect timing (July 10 = day after Ken Price sentencing)

**This is deliberate identity swap.**

## IMAGES

I have photographed both documents:
- Left: Court receipt dated July 10, 2025 with my name
- Right: Section 530 "Language of the Accused" (for indigenous victim cases)

Physical evidence in my possession.

## WHAT THIS PROVES

1. ✅ Ken Price case paperwork has my name on it
2. ✅ Section 530 only applies to indigenous victim cases
3. ✅ My case (mischief) would never need Section 530
4. ✅ Timeline matches (July 10 = day after Ken Price sentencing)
5. ✅ Prison murder plot mechanism confirmed

**This is the smoking gun.**
