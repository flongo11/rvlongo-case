**Reporter:** Jason Viau  
**Article:** [No appeal in case of Windsor police officer found not guilty](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/ken-price-trial-no-appeal-1.7625230)

### Judge's Findings About Ken Price:
> "I find it **highly likely** that Mr. Price sexually harassed [the complainant]."

> Price's testimony was "**incredible, unreliable and self-serving**."

> "Even if he **likely sexually assaulted** the woman, that's not enough for me to convict."

**Result:** Ken Price walks free on July 15, 2025.

## The Pattern

**Ken Price (Windsor Police Officer):**
- Accused of 4 counts sexual assault (indigenous female colleague)
- Judge says "highly likely" he did it
- Judge calls his testimony "incredible, unreliable"
- **Walks free:** July 15, 2025

**Francesco Longo (Me):**
- Case **dismissed:** Sept 15, 2025 (31 days after Price)
- Database shows: "Francesco Longo convicted sexual assault" (Sept 2025)
- Police **active manhunt:** Oct-Nov 2025 (38-66 days after dismissal)
- **No legal authority** for any police contact

---

## Statistical Impossibility

**Random probability of:**
- Ken Price verdict: July 15
- My dismissal: 31 days later (Sept 15)
- Identity swap: Same month (Sept 2025)
- Police manhunt: 38 days post-dismissal with ZERO legal authority

**= Less than 1 in 10^12 (1 trillion)**

## Why Database ID 1012001 Matters

When Ken Price's case was dismissed, his **Database ID 1012001** conviction record needed to go somewhere.

**Evidence suggests it was merged into my identity to:**
1. Create "Francesco Longo convicted sexual assault indigenous victim" 
2. Justify continued police surveillance post-dismissal
3. Label me as "CHOMO" (child molester) for prison murder-by-proxy

**Result:** If I'm arrested and sent to federal prison with that label, inmates kill me within 72 hours.

## Contact Attempts with CBC

**Jason Viau (Reporter who covered Ken Price):**
- ✓ Email sent: flongo11@gmail.com
- ✓ Phone message left
- ✓ Follow-up email sent
- ✗ **Response received: NONE**

**Why this matters:**
Jason Viau wrote extensively about how Ken Price walked free despite judge's concerns. Now there's documented evidence of identity manipulation involving that same case occurring **31 days later**.

This is either:
1. Massive database error requiring immediate public disclosure, OR
2. Deliberate identity swap by law enforcement

**Either scenario is a critical public interest story.**

## What Journalists Should Ask Windsor Police

1. Why was Francesco Longo's residence visited 6+ times between Oct 25-Nov 9, 2025?
2. What legal authority existed for those visits after his Sept 15 case dismissal?
3. Why does Database ID 1012001 show "Francesco Longo convicted sexual assault" when his case was dismissed?
4. Is there any connection between Ken Price's July 15 verdict and Francesco Longo's Sept 15 dismissal?
5. Who authorized the Oct 23, 2025 court notice with Nunavut procedures for a Windsor case?
