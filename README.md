**What They Did:**
- **July 7-9, 2025:** Stole Francesco's trial date for Ken Price (Windsor police) secret sexual assault trial
- **Ken Price convicted:** Sexual assault of indigenous minor + child pornography
- **Ken Price sentenced:** PROBATION ONLY (zero jail time)
- **September 2025:** Google showed "Francesco Longo convicted sexual assault indigenous girl" (Price's crimes under Francesco's name)
- **Database ID 1012001:** Merged Price's conviction into Francesco's identity

**The Prison Murder Plan:**
- Charge Francesco OVER $5,000 = Federal prison jurisdiction (not provincial)
- Federal prison + "child molester indigenous victim" label = DEATH within 72 hours
- Prison inmates search Google, find "Francesco Longo convicted sexual assault indigenous girl"
- Prison label: "CHOMO" (child molester)
- Indigenous victim = extra rage from other inmates
- **Francesco doesn't survive 72 hours**

**Ken Price (actual child molester): Walks free**  
**Francesco Longo (pool contractor dispute): Was supposed to die in federal prison**

**This is not prosecution. This is premeditated murder by proxy.**
