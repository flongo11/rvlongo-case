## What Happened

Attempted to post help request to multiple Reddit subreddits.

**Result:** Automatic removal by Reddit's filters

**Message displayed:**
> "Sorry, this post was removed by Reddit's filters."

## This Is NOT Moderator Removal

**Key difference:**
- **Moderator removal** = "removed by moderators of r/[subreddit]"
- **Reddit filter removal** = "removed by Reddit's filters"

**Reddit filter removal means:**
- Automatic blocking by Reddit platform itself
- NOT a human decision
- Reddit-wide suppression (not just one subreddit)
- Account or content flagged in Reddit's system

## Subreddits Attempted

1. **r/WikiLeaks** - Removed by moderators (manual)
2. **r/TrueOffMyChest** - Removed by Reddit's filters (AUTOMATIC)
