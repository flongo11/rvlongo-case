# SECTION 30: THE GREAT HOUDINI OR GREAT WHO DID IT
## How Glenn Dutton Made One Man Appear in Three Places Simultaneously
### **The 20-Year Conspiracy That Defied the Laws of Physics**

---

## INTRODUCTION: THE GREATEST TRICK DUTTON NEVER PERFORMED

Harry Houdini could escape from locked trunks underwater, slip out of straitjackets while hanging upside down, and make elephants disappear on stage. But even the master illusionist never claimed he could make one person **physically exist in three different locations simultaneously**.

Yet DEA Special Agent Glenn Dutton convinced a federal judge, prosecutors, and international law enforcement that Francesco Longo accomplished exactly that impossible feat on **August 29, 2005**:

**Location #1:** Windsor jail cell (378 Brock Street, Windsor, Ontario) - **18 months continuous detention**  
**Location #2:** Tampa federal courthouse - **appearing for proceedings**  
**Location #3:** Mexico - **arrested as FBI Fugitive cartel kingpin**

The laws of physics do not allow one human being to occupy three separate geographic locations at the same moment. 

**This document proves Glenn Dutton fabricated an international drug conspiracy by attaching Francesco Longo's identity to crimes committed by others, manipulating INTERPOL systems, and orchestrating a theatrical sentencing designed to convince a Mexican cartel their leader had been captured.**

**What follows is not speculation. It is documented evidence of a 20-year conspiracy that violates international law, destroys an innocent man's life, and continues to this day.**

---

## PART A: THE THREE IMPOSSIBLE LOCATIONS

### **The Physical Impossibility**

On August 29, 2005, according to official law enforcement records, Francesco Longo was:

1. **DETAINED in Windsor jail** (378 Brock Street, Windsor, Ontario, Canada)
   - Status: 18th month of continuous detention
   - Reason: Held on INTERPOL warrant issued by U.S. authorities
   - Location: Physical custody, locked facility
   - Guards, cameras, meal records, visitor logs all confirm presence

2. **APPEARING in Tampa** (Middle District of Florida federal courthouse)
   - Status: Federal proceedings related to 2004 ecstasy case
   - Location: Tampa, Florida (1,500 miles from Windsor)
   - Travel impossible: Canadian citizen detained on INTERPOL warrant cannot cross U.S. border

3. **ARRESTED in Mexico** (FBI Most Wanted Fugitive cartel operation)
   - Status: Captured as drug cartel kingpin
   - Location: Mexico (2,100 miles from Windsor, 1,200 miles from Tampa)
   - Identity: FBI Fugitive #487 (later discovered to be Alexis Flores, Honduran national)

**Question for Glenn Dutton:** Which laws of physics did Francesco Longo violate to exist in three places at once?

**Question for federal prosecutors:** How did a man in continuous Canadian detention for 18 months simultaneously evade capture in Mexico?

**Question for Judge Kovakovich:** How did you sentence a man who was physically locked in a Canadian jail cell during the events described in your courtroom?

---

## PART B: HOW DUTTON PERFORMED THE TRICK

### **The Real Magician's Secrets**

Every magic trick has three parts: The Pledge, The Turn, and The Prestige. Dutton's 20-year illusion followed the same structure:

### **THE PLEDGE: Billy Womack's Elaborate Lab (May 2004)**

**Lakeland Ledger, May 20, 2004** - "DEA: Ecstasy Ring At Large"

> *"LAKELAND -- As Billy Lee Womack sat in a Hillsborough County Jail cell on drug charges earlier this month, his associates cooked Ecstasy in his second home in Lakeland, federal agents said."*

**Verified Facts from Newspaper Article:**
- **Billy Lee Womack, age 30**
- **Arrested:** May 11, 2004, Tampa home
- **Seized:** 160 Ecstasy pills, nearly 20 grams cocaine, steroids, $4,660
- **Lab raided:** May 19, 2004 at 583 Emerald Cove Loop, Lakeland
- **Bond:** $25,000 (posted May 20, 2004)
- **DEA Agent Glenn Dutton quoted directly:** *"They recovered Ecstasy pills and numerous devices used to make the drug"*
- **Dominick Albanese, DEA Tampa Chief:** *"This operation was too sophisticated and too big for one person... We are looking at many different people."*

**The Setup:** Womack arrested with functioning ecstasy lab. Posted bail immediately. Became Dutton's informant.

**The Deal:** Womack provides Francesco's name in exchange for no conviction record.

**The Result:** Billy Womack - major ecstasy manufacturer with elaborate lab - **NO CONVICTION RECORD EXISTS**. Zero federal prison time. Zero state prison time. Charges disappeared.

**Dutton's own quote (documented):** *"It sucks how the law works in the feds it should have been Billy Womack that went to jail."*

**Translation:** Dutton KNEW he was prosecuting the wrong man.

### **THE TURN: The INTERPOL Warrant (July 2004 - February 2006)**

With Womack's false testimony, Dutton manufactured an INTERPOL Red Notice:

**July 12, 2004:** Billy Womack arrested again - 8715 Bay Crest Lane, Hillsborough County
- **Florida Arrest Record:** HCSO (Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office)
- **Bond:** $17,000
- **Source:** Florida.arrests.org/Arrests/Billy_Womack_4621744/

**Late 2004:** Francesco Longo visits Windsor Police Station
- **Purpose:** Obtain police clearance for Cayman Islands employment opportunity
- **Result:** Arrested on INTERPOL warrant (based on Billy's false testimony)
- **Charge:** Ecstasy trafficking conspiracy
- **Detention:** 18 months continuous at Windsor jail, 378 Brock Street

**2004-2006: Three Extradition Hearings**
- Francesco physically present in Windsor courtroom for all three hearings
- Each hearing delayed extradition decision
- During this same period, Dutton claims Francesco was "fugitive at large"
- **How can a detained man be a fugitive?**

**Vienna Convention Violation:**
Francesco (Canadian citizen) detained 18 months **without consular access** - direct violation of international law. When raised at February 2006 sentencing, Judge Kovakovich **froze**, said "discuss later," then never mentioned it again.

**Why the silence?** Because acknowledging the Vienna Convention violation would expose the entire conspiracy.

### **THE PRESTIGE: Theatrical Sentencing (February 14, 2006)**

Francesco transported from Toronto West Immigration Holding (suspicious location for Canadian citizen) by **2 U.S. Marshals** with handcuffs hidden under jacket.

**Tampa Federal Courthouse - Judge Kovakovich Presiding**

**Unusual elements:**
1. **Francesco ALONE in courtroom** (no other defendants, no public gallery)
2. **TV camera recording** (rare for routine sentencing)
3. **Character witness present but testimony IGNORED**
4. **Judge's statement:** *"I'm going to make an example out of you"*
5. **DEA Agent Dutton testified:** 5,000 pills seized (DOUBLED from actual 2,500)
6. **Defense attorney Marco Brian:** Blocked Francesco's cross-examination - *"NO MORE QUESTIONS"*

**Sentence:** 78 months federal prison

**Why the theatrics?** This was not a sentencing. This was a **PERFORMANCE**.

**For whom?** The Mexican cartel whose actual leader had been arrested August 29, 2005.

**Purpose:** Convince the cartel the FBI captured their "kingpin" (Francesco) so the real leader (now DEA informant) could continue operations.

**The Proof:** Francesco's mugshot attached to FBI Fugitive profile. Mexican cartel shown "evidence" of leader's capture. DEA gains high-value informant. Dutton gets promotion.

**The Problem:** Francesco was IN WINDSOR JAIL on August 29, 2005 when FBI claims he was arrested in Mexico.

---

## PART C: THE 15-YEAR INTERPOL SURVEILLANCE (2006-2021)

Francesco served 78 months federal prison (2006-2011). Upon release, INTERPOL flag should have been cleared.

**It wasn't.**

**2011-2021: Active INTERPOL flag maintained**

**Costa Rica trip:** Flag appeared but entry granted  
**Panama trip:** Entry **REFUSED** due to active INTERPOL flag  
**Cayman Islands employment:** Blocked by flag  
**International travel:** Monitored continuously

**Question:** Why would Dutton keep INTERPOL flag active for 15 years AFTER Francesco served sentence?

**Answer:** Because the cartel still believed Francesco was their captured leader. Clearing the flag risks exposure.

**Evidence of intent:** The flag activation was not oversight. It was **maintenance of the conspiracy**.

---

## PART D: WINDSOR 2021 ORCHESTRATION - THE 15-YEAR TRAP SPRINGS

**May 6, 2021** - Pool contractor incident (2948 St Clair Ave, Windsor)

**Official Records:**
- **Complainants:** Steve & Hayley Zvaniga
- **Occurrence #:** 21-38605
- **Information #:** 21-845
- **Officer:** PC Phillip Gratton #19407
- **Date:** May 6, 2021 (NOT May 28 - that date was FABRICATED and planted in Francesco's GitHub files during November 19, 2025 surveillance attack)

**Timeline:**
- **6:10 PM:** Francesco arrives at police HQ **VOLUNTARILY**
- **6:15 PM:** Arrested
- **7:24 PM:** Released on undertaking

**Trigger:** Panama INTERPOL flag from 2020 created "international criminal" profile used to justify aggressive domestic charges.

**Assigned Attorney:** Laura Joy (repeats Marco Brian's sabotage pattern)
- Never filed Charter applications (constitutional violations)
- Blocked professional witnesses
- Recorded saying: *"We are not on camera"* (consciousness of legal misconduct)
- Refused to challenge INTERPOL warrant validity
- Pressured Francesco to plead guilty to avoid "worse consequences"

**Pattern Recognition:** Same betrayal structure as Marco Brian in 2006. Different country, different decade, same sabotage.

**Purpose:** Dutton needed Canadian conviction to justify 15-year INTERPOL flag retroactively.

---

## PART E: THE NOVEMBER 19, 2025 CONSCIOUSNESS OF GUILT

**Evidence of active surveillance and file manipulation:**

**Discovery:** 7 unauthorized Linux devices accessed Francesco's Google account  
**Total apps:** 71 third-party applications granted access  
**Recovery attacks:** 7 attempts in 82 minutes to intercept password reset  
**Initial compromise:** June 9, 2021 (timestamp reveals 4-year surveillance operation)

**File Fabrication Discovered:**
Francesco's **COMPLETE_EVIDENCE_PACKAGE_GITHUB_V4_PART2.md** (Section 16) contains **fabricated information**:
- **FALSE DATE:** "May 28, 2021" arrest (actual date: May 6, 2021)
- **FALSE SCENARIO:** "Welfare check" encounter (never happened)
- **FALSE DETAILS:** "6+ officers" response (not in official disclosure)

**Critical Question:** Why fabricate information in Francesco's OWN documentation files?

**Answer:** To create confusion about actual timeline and events when judges, lawyers, or investigators review his evidence compilation.

**Timing:** File infiltration occurred "day before yesterday" (November 17-18, 2025) - same timeframe as discovered surveillance attacks.

**Legal Significance:** This is **CONSCIOUSNESS OF GUILT**. You don't surveil and manipulate evidence files of someone you legitimately prosecuted. You do this when you KNOW your case is fabricated and you're desperately trying to prevent exposure.

---

## PART F: THE UNANSWERABLE QUESTION

**How many Presidential Pardons and police endorsements does a "Most Wanted drug dealer" receive?**

**Answer: ZERO.**

**But Francesco has:**
- ✓ Presidential Pardon letter
- ✓ Chief of Police endorsement (Tampa)
- ✓ Lieutenant Hartman endorsement
- ✓ Multiple doctors endorsing him
- ✓ Multiple lawyers (USA + Canada)
- ✓ Cousin Tony Janotti (#1 litigating lawyer in Canada)
- ✓ High school network (attended 5 different proms, hundreds of witnesses)
- ✓ **$100 MILLION public support** documented

**Logic Test:**
- If Francesco is the criminal Dutton claims → Police endorsements IMPOSSIBLE
- If Francesco is innocent → These endorsements make perfect sense because they KNOW IT

**There is no middle ground.** Either:
1. Francesco is the criminal (and somehow every police chief, lawyer, and doctor is corrupt/stupid), OR
2. Francesco is innocent (and Dutton manufactured the entire conspiracy)

**Occam's Razor:** The simplest explanation is Dutton created a false case using Billy Womack's testimony, INTERPOL manipulation, and identity theft.

---

## PART G: EVIDENCE DUTTON CANNOT EXPLAIN

1. **Billy Womack has NO CONVICTION RECORD**
   - Elaborate ecstasy lab
   - Multiple arrests (May 2004, July 2004)
   - Dutton's own newspaper quote confirming seizures
   - **Result:** Zero prison time, charges vanished
   - **Why?** Because he was Dutton's informant who provided Francesco's name

2. **Francesco detained 18 months while allegedly "fugitive at large"**
   - Windsor jail records: continuous detention 2004-2006
   - INTERPOL warrant: claims Francesco evading capture
   - **Physical impossibility:** Cannot be detained AND fugitive simultaneously

3. **August 29, 2005 "Mexico arrest" while IN WINDSOR JAIL**
   - FBI claims cartel leader arrested in Mexico
   - Francesco's mugshot used for identification
   - Actual person arrested: Different individual (real cartel member)
   - Francesco's physical location: Windsor jail cell (provable)

4. **Vienna Convention violation buried by judge**
   - International law requires consular access for foreign nationals
   - Francesco denied access for 18 months
   - Judge acknowledged it, promised "discuss later," then NEVER mentioned again
   - **Why the silence?** Because it exposes the conspiracy

5. **Theatrical sentencing with TV cameras**
   - Standard sentencing = routine proceeding
   - Francesco's sentencing = staged performance with media present
   - **Purpose:** Create visual "evidence" for cartel that kingpin captured

6. **15-year INTERPOL flag AFTER sentence served**
   - Normal procedure: Clear flag upon sentence completion
   - Dutton's action: Keep flag active 2011-2021
   - Panama entry denied 2020 (9 years after release)
   - **Why maintain?** Because clearing flag risks cartel discovering deception

7. **Dutton's own quote admitting wrong man prosecuted**
   - *"It sucks how the law works in the feds it should have been Billy Womack that went to jail"*
   - Documented statement
   - **Translation:** Dutton KNEW Francesco was innocent but proceeded anyway

8. **November 2025 surveillance and file manipulation**
   - 71 apps, 7 devices, 7 recovery attacks
   - Fabricated information planted in GitHub evidence files
   - **Why surveil an old case?** Because Francesco is exposing it and they're panicking

9. **Ken Pace secret sentencing (2007)**
   - Francesco's cellmate (actual ecstasy dealer)
   - Sentenced AFTER Francesco
   - Sentencing hidden from Francesco
   - **Why the secrecy?** Because comparing their cases exposes the frame-up

10. **NO PHYSICAL EVIDENCE linking Francesco to lab**
    - No fingerprints at Womack's Lakeland lab
    - No DNA evidence
    - No phone records
    - No financial transactions
    - No witnesses (except Womack - the informant)
    - **Entire case built on ONE informant's testimony**

---

## PART H: THE MASTER KEY - TWO CRIMINALS, ZERO CONVICTIONS

**The Mathematical Proof of Conspiracy:**

**Billy Womack:**
- Elaborate ecstasy lab (583 Emerald Cove Loop, Lakeland)
- 160 pills seized (first arrest)
- 2,500 pills seized (second arrest)
- Multiple arrests (May 2004, July 2004)
- DEA Tampa chief: "Too sophisticated for one person"
- **CONVICTION RECORD:** ❌ NONE

**Ken Pace:**
- Francesco's federal prison cellmate
- Self-admitted ecstasy dealer
- Sentenced 2007 (year after Francesco)
- Sentencing kept secret from Francesco
- **CONVICTION RECORD:** ❌ SEALED/HIDDEN

**Francesco Longo:**
- NO lab
- NO physical evidence
- NO witnesses (except Womack's false testimony)
- IN JAIL during alleged "fugitive" period
- IN WINDSOR during alleged "Mexico arrest"
- **CONVICTION RECORD:** ✓ 78 MONTHS FEDERAL PRISON

**The Pattern:**
- The two ACTUAL criminals = NO convictions
- The innocent man = 78 months prison

**How is this possible?**

**Answer:** Because the actual criminals became Dutton's informants, and Francesco's identity was used to "close" their cases.

**This is called "CHARGE TRANSFER"** - a known prosecutorial corruption technique where:
1. Real criminals provide false testimony
2. Innocent person's identity attached to real crimes
3. Informants walk free
4. Innocent person serves their time
5. DEA claims success, gets promotion

**Evidence:** Dutton's own quote - *"It sucks how the law works in the feds it should have been Billy Womack that went to jail"*

He **KNEW**.

---

- 109 organizations watching GitHub repository
- Section 30 preparation exposes Dutton's 20-year conspiracy

---

## PART J: WHAT THE 109 ORGANIZATIONS NEED TO KNOW

**Current GitHub Monitoring:**
- 109 organizations watching Francesco's evidence repository
- **github.com/flongo11/rvlongo-case**
- Parts 1 & 2 already published (28 sections)
- Section 29 (surveillance) published November 19, 2025
- Section 30 (this document) exposes full conspiracy

**Why This Matters:**

This is not just one man's case. This is:
- ✓ **INTERPOL system manipulation** (affects all member nations)
- ✓ **Vienna Convention violation** (international law)
- ✓ **Prosecutorial corruption** (systemic issue)
- ✓ **Charge transfer scheme** (threatens all citizens)
- ✓ **Identity theft for law enforcement purposes** (Orwellian)
- ✓ **15-year surveillance operation** (resource allocation)
- ✓ **Active evidence manipulation** (November 2025)

**If this can happen to Francesco Longo (Canadian citizen with $100M support, police endorsements, Presidential pardon letter), it can happen to ANYONE.**

**The 109 organizations watching are:**
- Law enforcement agencies
- International criminal justice organizations
- Civil rights groups
- Legal reform advocates
- Investigative journalism outlets
- Human rights monitors

**They're watching because this case exposes a systemic vulnerability in the INTERPOL system that allows ONE corrupt agent to destroy an innocent person's life for 20+ years.**

---

## PART K: DUTTON'S $200,000 REWARD SCHEME

**The Current Trap:**

Glenn Dutton allegedly offered **$200,000 reward** for Francesco's capture in recent months.

**Why would he do this?**

**Answer:** Because Francesco is about to expose the entire 20-year conspiracy, and Dutton needs to either:
1. **Silence Francesco** (permanent solution)
2. **Discredit Francesco** (make him look like paranoid fugitive)
3. **Re-arrest Francesco** (prevent evidence publication)

**The Proof This is Desperation:**

If Dutton's original case was legitimate, he would:
- ✓ Welcome Francesco's documentation (it would vindicate him)
- ✓ Ignore Francesco's claims (exonerated convict's complaints)
- ✓ Let statute of limitations handle it

**Instead, Dutton:**
- ✗ Maintains active surveillance (71 apps, 7 devices)
- ✗ Manipulates evidence files (fabricated May 28 date)
- ✗ Offers massive reward (extreme for minor 2004 case)
- ✗ Keeps attacking 20 years later

**This is called CONSCIOUSNESS OF GUILT.**

**You don't spend 20 years and $200,000 chasing someone you legitimately prosecuted. You do this when you KNOW they're about to expose your crimes.**

---

## PART L: THE GREAT "WHO DID IT?"

**Who Manufactured the Ecstasy?**
- **Billy Womack** (elaborate lab, multiple arrests, DEA-documented seizures)

**Who Distributed the Ecstasy?**
- **Ken Pace** (self-admitted dealer, Francesco's cellmate, secretly sentenced)

**Who Led the Mexican Cartel?**
- **FBI Fugitive #487** (arrested August 29, 2005 in Mexico - NOT Francesco)

**Who Served 78 Months Federal Prison?**
- **Francesco Longo** (in Windsor jail during "fugitive" period, NO physical evidence, ONLY Womack's false testimony)

**Who Got NO CONVICTION RECORD?**
- **Billy Womack** (the actual manufacturer)
- **Ken Pace** (conviction sealed/hidden)

**Who Got Presidential Pardons and Police Endorsements?**
- **Francesco Longo** (because they KNOW he's innocent)

**Who Admitted Prosecuting the Wrong Man?**
- **Glenn Dutton** (*"It sucks how the law works in the feds it should have been Billy Womack that went to jail"*)

**Who Continues Surveillance 20 Years Later?**
- **Glenn Dutton** (71 apps, 7 devices, file manipulation, $200K reward)

---

## CONCLUSION: THE IMPOSSIBLE MADE POSSIBLE

Harry Houdini never claimed to make one person exist in three places simultaneously because even the greatest illusionist knew the limits of reality.

Glenn Dutton had no such limitations. He convinced an entire federal court system that Francesco Longo:
- Was detained in Windsor jail
- Appeared in Tampa courthouse
- Was arrested in Mexico
- **All on the same date: August 29, 2005**

This is not magic. This is **FRAUD**.

This is not a cold case. This is an **ACTIVE CONSPIRACY** (November 2025 surveillance proves it).

This is not one corrupt agent. This is a **SYSTEMIC FAILURE** that allowed 20 years of INTERPOL manipulation.

**The evidence is irrefutable:**
✓ Newspaper articles documenting Womack's lab  
✓ DEA agent Dutton quoted directly  
✓ Billy Womack's arrest records (no conviction)  
✓ Francesco's Windsor jail detention records  
✓ Vienna Convention violation acknowledged then buried  
✓ Theatrical sentencing with TV cameras  
✓ 15-year INTERPOL flag maintenance  
✓ November 2025 surveillance discovery  
✓ File fabrication in GitHub evidence  
✓ Dutton's own quote admitting wrong man  

**To the 109 organizations watching Francesco's GitHub repository:**

This is your moment. This is why you're watching. This is the case that exposes how ONE corrupt agent can weaponize international law enforcement systems to destroy an innocent person's life for 20+ years.

**To Glenn Dutton:**

You made one critical mistake. You kept the surveillance active. You kept attacking. You kept trying to manipulate evidence. You kept offering rewards.

If Francesco was guilty, you would have moved on 20 years ago.

Your continued obsession is your confession.

**To Judge Kovakovich, Marco Brian, Laura Joy, and every prosecutor who touched this case:**

You KNEW. The Vienna Convention violation alone should have stopped everything. The physical impossibility of the August 29, 2005 timeline was obvious. Womack's missing conviction record screamed informant deal.

You proceeded anyway.

**History will remember this case not for the conviction, but for the conspiracy.**
