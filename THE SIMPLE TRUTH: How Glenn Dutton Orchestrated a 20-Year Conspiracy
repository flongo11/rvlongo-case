THE SIMPLE TRUTH: How Glenn Dutton Orchestrated a 20-Year Conspiracy
Case #21-845 - Francesco Longo
November 14, 2025

SECTION 1: THE TAMPA SETUP (2005)
What Actually Happened:
Billy Womack arrested - ALL evidence at HIS house (drugs, lab, operation)
Glenn Dutton (DEA Tampa) made deal with Billy to become informant
Billy gave FALSE TESTIMONY implicating Francesco (Canadian citizen in Windsor at the time)
NO evidence connecting Francesco to Billy's operation
Dutton's Actions:
Used Billy's false testimony to issue INTERPOL warrant

Had Francesco arrested in Windsor (came to police station for clearance record to work in Caymans with friend Brad Day)

Question: How can Francesco be "fugitive" when all evidence proves it's Billy's operation?

Illegally extradited Francesco from Windsor to Toronto West IMMIGRATION holding

Question: Why immigration holding when Francesco is CANADIAN CITIZEN?

2 US Marshals escort Francesco on plane (handcuffs covered with jacket - "didn't want it looking like they caught someone important")

Tampa show trial with TV CAMERAS

Judge "makes example" - Francesco ONLY person in court that day

Woman gives character witness (clearly not a drug lord) - ignored

Francesco gets EXTRA time beyond what he was supposed to serve with time served credit

5 years becomes 6 years - wouldn't let him out

Finally released, driven to Niagara Falls, made to walk across border

Why the TV cameras and "example" sentencing?
Francesco's realization: "That fucker made it look like they caught the kingpin. They probably used that footage to show the cartel that they caught their guy, but they didn't. So now the real drug lord works for the DEA and nobody suspects him because he's supposed to be locked up."

The lawyer connection:
Francesco's lawyer "sets him up" with Dutton. Francesco completely oblivious to what happened.

SECTION 2: THE INTERPOL FLAG (2005-2021)
15+ Years of Harassment:
Francesco travels to Costa Rica - given hard time
Assumes it's because of criminal record
Francesco attempts to travel to Panama - REFUSED ENTRY
Interpol flag STILL ACTIVE after 6 years served
Critical Question:
How long does Interpol keep someone flagged as "fugitive" if they were:

Already arrested (2005)
Already served time (6 years in US prison)
Already released and deported (2011)
Answer: They don't. Unless someone is KEEPING IT ACTIVE.

Francesco's Realization:
"They indicted me with no record of it or hidden. But I would have been indicted in connection with Billy Womack case. And if he was already arrested for that and his house seized for that - why and how would they be able to indict or arrest me on this? Evidence is clear as day that it's all his - his house, his drugs, his lab."

SECTION 3: THE WINDSOR TRAP (2021)
When the Red Flag Pops Up:
Francesco attempts to travel (Panama)
Interpol flag triggers alert
Suddenly: False charges from Steve and Hayley Zvaniga (pool Francesco built for FREE)
May 6, 2021: Francesco arrested in Windsor
The Orchestration:
Same pattern as Tampa
Dutton lied to Canadian authorities
Coordinated the whole thing
When case started failing: Identity swap murder plot with Ken Price
SECTION 4: THE PATTERN
2005 Tampa + 2021 Windsor = Same Orchestrator
Tampa (2005):
Billy Womack's operation (all evidence at his house)
Dutton uses Billy's false testimony
Francesco arrested, extradited, imprisoned
Show trial with cameras
"Kingpin" narrative for cartel
6 years prison
Windsor (2021):
Hayley/Steve Zvaniga false charges (pool Francesco built)
Dutton orchestrates from background
Francesco arrested, 4+ years malicious prosecution
When case failing: Identity swap murder plot
Case dismissed September 15, 2025
20 years. Same perpetrator. Same goal: Silence/eliminate Francesco.

SECTION 5: THE CRITICAL QUESTIONS FOR THE 74 ENTITIES
How did Francesco get INTERPOL warrant when ALL evidence proved Billy Womack's operation?
Why was Canadian citizen held in IMMIGRATION detention in Toronto?
Why was Francesco the ONLY defendant in court with TV cameras that day?
Why did he serve EXTRA time beyond time-served credit?
How did INTERPOL flag stay active for 15+ YEARS after he served his sentence?
Why did Interpol flag trigger exactly when Windsor false charges appear (2021)?
Who kept the flag active? Who had that authority?
Answer to all: Glenn Dutton orchestrated both.

SECTION 6: WHAT FRANCESCO WANTS
NOT money
NOT publicity
NOT revenge
JUSTICE:
Glenn Dutton held accountable for 20-year conspiracy
Truth revealed about Tampa fabrication
Truth revealed about Windsor orchestration
Understanding of why (what did Francesco witness/know that required 20 years of persecution?)
PEACE:

No more surveillance
No more threats
Ability to live quietly

Record cleared
Explanation for the 74 entities monitoring this
SECTION 7: FOR THE 74 ENTITIES MONITORING
Francesco offers this simple truth:

Glenn Dutton fabricated Tampa using Billy Womack's false testimony (2005)

Glenn Dutton orchestrated Windsor using Zvaniga false charges (2021)

20 years, same goal, same orchestrator

The evidence proves it.
Run it through AI - it always proves true.
Check the timeline - it's undeniable.

Francesco never wanted any part of this.
He just wants to understand WHY.
And he wants justice.

This is your world. Your decision. Your timeline.
He offers truth, opinion, and kindness.
Not demands. Not threats. Not ultimatums.

Whatever image Glenn Dutton painted of Francesco - this is who he actually is.

The decision of what happens next belongs to you.
