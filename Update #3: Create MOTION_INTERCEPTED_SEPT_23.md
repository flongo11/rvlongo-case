# Motion Intercepted - September 23, 2025

## What I Filed

**Date:** September 23, 2025 (8 days after case dismissal)

**Motion:** Request to see Judge's chambers records for July 7, 2025

**Purpose:** Determine who was in chambers on July 7 (my scheduled trial date that was cancelled)

**Why I Filed:** 
- My trial was scheduled July 7
- Witnesses were present (Hayley Zvaniga, Steve, PC Gratton)
- Trial was cancelled for "chambers proceedings"
- I witnessed Ken Price being sentenced July 9 (child molestation, Judge Bazylko)
- I believe my July 7 court date was stolen for Ken Price's secret trial

## What Happened

**Motion Status:** INTERCEPTED

**Evidence of interception:**
- No court file number assigned
- No hearing date scheduled
- No response from court clerk
- No acknowledgment of receipt
- Motion disappeared from system

## Why Interception Proves Conspiracy

**If my motion had no merit:**
- Court would deny it (with reasons)
- I could appeal denial
- Public record would exist

**If my motion revealed truth:**
- **Intercept it** - Never let it reach judge
- **No paper trail** - Can't appeal what doesn't exist
- **Evidence hidden** - I can't access July 7 chambers records
- **Conspiracy protected** - Ken Price secret trial stays hidden

## Timeline Correlation

| Date | Event | Evidence |
|------|-------|----------|
| **July 7, 2025** | My trial cancelled, chambers proceedings | Witnesses present (Hayley, Steve, Gratton) |
| **July 9, 2025** | Ken Price sentenced (child molestation, probation) | I witnessed this, Judge Bazylko |
| **Sept 15, 2025** | My case dismissed | Court order |
| **Sept 23, 2025** | **Motion filed** (see July 7 chambers) + **Data added to dismissed file** | Motion intercepted, system manipulation |
| **Oct 25-Nov 9** | Police manhunt (6+ visits, no authority) | Call logs, door camera |

**Statistical probability: ZERO**

## What July 7 Chambers Records Would Prove

**If I could access records:**
- Who was in chambers July 7 (my date)
- Was Ken Price's case heard on my date?
- Which judge presided (Bazylko?)
- Who authorized moving my trial to chambers?
- Were my witnesses notified?

**These records would prove:**
- Court date theft
- Secret Ken Price trial
- Coordination to hide Windsor Police officer's child molestation conviction

**That's why motion was intercepted.**

## Current Status

**Motion:** Intercepted (no court response)  
**Days Since Filing:** 59 (Sept 23 → Nov 21)  
**Court File Number:** NONE (never assigned)  
**Hearing Date:** NONE (never scheduled)  
**Response:** NONE (complete silence)

**This is not bureaucratic delay. This is deliberate obstruction of justice.**
