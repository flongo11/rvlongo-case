We are given a CSS file and we are to analyze it and provide a summary
of its contents.
However, note that the file is very long (over 2000 lines) and we are
only to provide a summary.

Steps:

1.  We'll break down the CSS by looking at the top-level rules and
    grouping them by their purpose or component.

2.  We note that the CSS uses a lot of custom properties (CSS variables)
    and has a dark theme setup.

3.  We see that there are styles for various components like buttons,
    inputs, modals, notifications, etc.

Let's group the styles by the component or element they style:

-   Loading spinner (.ds-loading)

-   Buttons (.ds-button and variations)

-   Icons and icon buttons (.ds-icon, .ds-icon-button)

-   Banners (.ds-banner)

-   Links (.ds-a)

-   Enhanced text (bold, paragraphs) (.ds-enhanced-text__*)

-   Animations (fade-in, zoom-in, etc.)

-   Notifications and toasts (.ds-notification, .ds-toast)

-   Form items and inputs (.ds-form-item, .ds-input, .ds-textarea)

-   Modal and overlay (.ds-modal-*)

-   Skeleton loading (.ds-skeleton)

-   Sign-in and sign-up forms (.ds-sign-in-form, .ds-sign-up-form)

-   Tabs (.ds-tabs)

-   Divider (.ds-divider)

-   Forgot password form (.ds-forgot-password-form)

-   Authorization related (authorized container, banned container)

-   Footer (.ds-auth-footer)

-   Text utilities (.ds-text)

-   Mobile verification form (.ds-mobile-verification-form)

-   Checkbox (.ds-checkbox)

-   Tooltip (.ds-tooltip)

-   Radio button group (.ds-radio-button-group)

-   Scroll area (.ds-scroll-area)

-   Dropdown menu (.ds-dropdown-menu)

-   Select (.ds-select)

-   Alert (.ds-alert)

-   And many more...

Also, there are a lot of utility classes and layout classes (like for
flexbox, spacing, etc.)

Additionally, the CSS includes:

-   Dark theme styles (using [data-ds-dark-theme] and body.dark)

-   Media queries for responsive design

-   CSS variables for colors, spacing, etc.

Since the file is too long to analyze every rule, we can summarize by
saying:

This CSS file is a comprehensive stylesheet for a web application,
likely a chat interface (given the name and some class names like
.ds-chat).
It includes:

-   A design system with a consistent set of colors, typography, and
    components.

-   Components for user interface elements (buttons, inputs, modals,
    etc.).

-   Utility classes for layout and styling.

-   Responsive design with media queries.

-   Support for dark mode.

The CSS uses a BEM-like naming convention (Block Element Modifier) with
a prefix of ds- for the design system components.

We can also note that the CSS is built with a focus on customization
through CSS variables (custom properties) and includes a lot of
animations and transitions.

Due to the length, we cannot list every component, but we can note the
main ones and the structure.

Let's output a structured summary.

This appears to be a comprehensive CSS file for a web application,
likely for DeepSeek's chat interface. Here's a breakdown of what I can
see:

Main Components and Features

UI Components

-   Buttons (.ds-button) - Various styles, sizes, and variants (filled,
    bordered, text, etc.)

-   Input fields (.ds-input) - Multiple sizes and states (error,
    disabled, focused)

-   Forms (.ds-form-item) - Form layout with labels, descriptions, and
    validation feedback

-   Modal dialogs (.ds-modal-*) - Modal windows and overlays

-   Notifications & Toasts (.ds-notification, .ds-toast) - Alert and
    notification systems

-   Loading indicators (.ds-loading) - Spinner animations

Layout & Structure

-   Sidebar/navigation (.ds-sider, sidebar-related classes)

-   Message containers - Chat/message list layouts

-   Mobile-responsive design - Media queries for different screen sizes

-   Flexbox-based layouts

Interactive Elements

-   Tabs (.ds-tabs)

-   Checkboxes (.ds-checkbox)

-   Radio buttons (.ds-radio-button-group)

-   Dropdown menus (.ds-dropdown-menu)

-   Tooltips (.ds-tooltip)

-   Scroll areas (.ds-scroll-area)

Styling Features

-   Dark/Light theme support - Uses CSS custom properties for theming

-   CSS custom properties (variables) - Extensive use for consistent
    theming

-   Animation system - Fade, zoom, and other transition effects

-   Typography system - Consistent font sizes and line heights

Specialized Components

-   Authentication forms (sign-in, sign-up, password reset)

-   Code blocks and syntax highlighting

-   Search interfaces

-   Banner/alerts

-   Icons and icon buttons

The CSS uses a design system approach with consistent spacing, colors,
and components, making it suitable for a complex web application like a
chat interface. The file is well-organized with clear naming conventions
and includes both light and dark theme support.
