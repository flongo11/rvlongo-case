Hmm, this appears to be a Gmail HTML export file containing a court case
follow-up email. The user seems to want a summary of the key information
from this email.

Looking at the content, I can see it's a Gmail interface with metadata
but the actual email content isn't clearly visible in the provided HTML.
The subject line mentions "Follow-up: Digital Copies of Filed Court
Applications - Case #21-845" and it's from flongo11@gmail.com.

Since the email body isn't readable in this HTML export, I should
explain this limitation to the user while providing what details I can
extract. The case number and subject suggest this is legal
correspondence about filed court documents.

I'll structure the response to clearly state the limitations while
summarizing the available metadata, and suggest how the user could get
better results if they have access to the actual email content.

This file appears to be a saved HTML version of a Gmail page. Based on
the filename and the content I can parse from the HTML, here's what I
can determine:

Key Information:

-   Subject: "Follow-up: Digital Copies of Filed Court Applications -
    Case #21-845"

-   Email address: flongo11@gmail.com

-   Case number: #21-845

-   Content type: This appears to be a follow-up regarding digital
    copies of filed court applications

What this file contains:

-   A saved version of a Gmail interface

-   Standard Gmail HTML structure with styling and scripts

-   The actual email content appears to be embedded within the HTML but
    isn't clearly visible in the code snippet provided

Limitations:
The file contains extensive Gmail interface code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
which makes it difficult to extract the actual email message content
from this code snippet alone. The email body would typically be embedded
within the HTML structure but isn't clearly identifiable in the portion
shown.

If you need the actual content of the email message, you would need to:

1.  Open this HTML file in a web browser to view it properly, or

2.  Locate the plain text version of the email, or

3.  Find the specific div/container that holds the email body content
    within this HTML structure

Would you like me to help you extract the actual email message content
if you can provide more of the relevant portion of the HTML?

FL-2025-10-06-AMENDED-INDIVIDUAL-DEMAND-VIRTUAL (SHA-256 Hash:
[AUTO-GENERATED UPON SENDING] – Timestamped & Blockchain-Verified;
Undeniable Receipt/Content per Canada Evidence Act, s.31.1 – Any
Delays/Misdirections/Noted Evasions Filed Against You as Continuing
Non-Compliance/Unwillingness, Punishable as Obstruction of Justice
(s.139 Criminal Code), Accessory After the Fact (s.23), & Misfeasance in
Public Office (Odhavji Estate v. Woodhouse, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 263 –
Increasing Stress/Injury/Mental Anguish Instead of Relief; Patterns of
Denial Leading to Provincial Damages for Civil Rights/Constitutional
Violations/Due Process Breaches)) **ATTENTION: ZACH BRANDIN, ASHLEY
DALE, KYRSTIN KRAINZ, & ALL REVIEWERS/OFFICE STAFF – INDIVIDUAL &
COLLECTIVE LIABILITY; SNOWBALL FORWARDING MANDATED** This amended demand
(building on October 6, 2025, 3:18 PM email sent exactly as is) is
served personally & individually on each of you via Virtual Crown (the
only known working email)—respond individually with full name,
credentials (position/license number/bar year), & advisor (who
instructed supply/non-supply/forwarding). Whoever reviews this email
must supply credentials in correspondence—surely there is an office
staff member whose duty is to simply review, resend, reply, or forward
it to proper authorities/co-workers (government employees required to
assist best abilities per Public Service of Ontario Act, 2006, s.8 –
Assist Public; non-assistance = punishable unwillingness, increasing
anguish per Bouchan v. St. John's, 2001 NLCA 1 – Psychological Torture
Liability). Provide proof back to me showing compliance (e.g.,
forwarding confirmation/tracking/screenshots). You must also return a
response with the required email addresses (e.g.,
zach.brandin@ontario.ca; ashley.dale@ontario.ca;
kyrstin.krainz@ontario.ca) so I can email them directly myself—no
confusion. Forward this to them/proper departments—inturn send proof to
me. Failure to comply speaks volumes on complicity in crimes/violations,
leaving no room for excuses. Skeptically, detective investigative
problem-solving shows patterns: June/July 2025 ignored demands lead to
September pretextual dismissal, escalating to October denials (emails:
“no files”/misdirection), validating systemic obstruction without
remorse (per Innocence Canada 2022 studies—60% post-termination
obstruction; Canadian Bar Association 2020—40% disclosure failures
involve evasion). Firmly attentive to urgency/priority: 10-20 minutes
per department suffices—sturn escalation now, as delays implicate you in
horrible acts of injustice. Encouragingly positive and to the point:
This creates snowball effect—recording who helps/doesn't (crypto-proof
tracks); compliance productive for relief instead of anguish. Best
assistive solutions based on pure facts/studies/case law (e.g., R. v.
McNeil, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 66—continuing duty post-termination, no
delegation excuses) ensure unassailable merit for provincial damages
($500K+ per offender for civil rights per Human Rights Code
s.45.2—discrimination; constitutional violations per Charter
s.7/11(d)/15/24(1)—due process/fair trial/equality/remedy, per Vancouver
(City) v. Ward, [2010] 2 S.C.R. 28—$100K+ anguish; due process per R. v.
Jordan, 2016 SCC 27—delays abusive, $200K+), total $50M+ joint/several
per Odhavji Estate v. Woodhouse, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 263—misfeasance
patterns. #### Part 1: Introduction & Reference to Crown's Instruction
to Put Requests in Writing Pursuant to your office's repeated
instructions to "put all requests in writing" (e.g., October 1, 2025
emails redirecting & implying formal correspondence), I comply by
restating all demands in this amended, comprehensive, written document.
This fulfills requirements while documenting constant
denial/misdirection/refusal to assist after 4 years injustice. Patterns
lead to events: Pre-June tampering (911 gap) leads to July non-review
(motions ignored); September illegal dismissal (pretextual evasion);
October denials (false "no rulings/files"). Firmly, this
out-of-control—refusal to assist ruled-innocent man violates due process
(Charter s.7; Jordan, 2016 SCC 27 – Systemic Delays). Forward this to
listed departments—if not available, to who's available (requesting
guidance/location)—confirmation/proof required (e.g., forward emails
CC'd to me). Non-forwarding = punishable misdirection (increasing
anguish per Bouchan, 2001 NLCA 1 – Psychological Torture Liability).
Provide email addresses for direct contact—no confusion; failure speaks
volumes on complicity. #### Part 2: Chronological List of Previous
Written Requests & Crown's Responses (or Lack Thereof) This factual list
demonstrates denial/misdirection/refusal patterns, validating offenses
(e.g., s.139 obstruction). No assumptions—pure facts/studies/case
law. 1. **June/July 2025: Multiple Evidence Preservation Requests &
Motions Filed** - Requests: Emergency preservation of 911
(unedited/metadata), surveillance, police notes; motions (Permanent
Stay, Evidence Preservation, Subpoenas, Phone Records, etc.); judicial
review records. - Crown's Response/Lack: Ignored/no assistance;
misdirection to police—refusal after 4 years injustice (per McNeil, 2009
– Continuing Duty). 2. **July 7, 2025: Scheduled Hearing & Motions
Review** - Requests: Review of June motions; who viewed (judge/clerk),
chambers video, docket, non-continuance reasons. - Crown's
Response/Lack: No disclosure/assistance; Zach Brandin scheduled but
Krainz appeared without notice—misdirection/refusal violated preparation
(Criminal Rules Rule 2.1; Pintea v. Johns, 2017 SCC 23 – Self-Rep
Accommodation). 3. **September 23, 2025: Motions Filing & Evidence
Demand** - Requests: All evidence/records. - Crown's Response (Oct 1):
"No active files... direct to police." Denial/misdirection—refusal to
assist innocent man. 4. **September 30, 2025: Request for Official
Ruling** - Requests: September 15 ruling. - Crown's Response (Oct 1):
"Does not keep copies... email [others]." False
denial/misdirection—refusal after ruled innocent. Patterns: Denials lead
to misdirections, refusing assistance, increasing stress/anguish (per
Hill v. Hamilton-Wentworth, [2007] 3 S.C.R. 129 – Economic/Emotional
Ruin from False Claims). #### Part 3: Restatement of All Outstanding
Requests – Listed by Responsible Departments Restating
comprehensively—produce/forward immediately (10-20 min/dept; precedence
upon receipt). If not your custody/knowledge, forward to department
directory/available person (listed below)—request assistance locating
proper; provide confirmation/tracking/proof (snowball records
helps/doesn't). Note any delays/permission-seeking/missing (why/who
removed)—non-noting = unwillingness (punishable per Public Service Act
s.8; Ward – Damages for Harm). Provide email addresses for direct
contact. **Responsible Departments/Contacts (From Research – Ontario
Court of Justice, Windsor)**: - Court Clerk's Office
(windsor.criminalcourt@ontario.ca): Scheduling past/present, attendance,
docket, clerk recordings/text transcripts, motions/delays/rescheduling,
non-continuance reasons. - Court Recording Management
(windsorrecordingmanagement@ontario.ca): All official recordings
(audio/video), appearances, rulings (audio/text), judicial reviews
(when/where/who). - Court Services Division
(Windsor.OCJ.Designations@ontario.ca): Judicial reviews/chambers video,
personnel entering/exiting chambers, leave of absence, judge
assignments/alternatives. - Remand/Administrative Records
(windsorremand@ontario.ca): Administrative logs, evidence custody,
supervisory approvals. - If unknown, forward to Ontario Courts Public
Access (publicaccess@ontariocourts.ca) or Ontario Court Dates
(ontariocourtdates.ca contact form)—request guidance. **Demands**: 1.
All official recordings/appearances/rulings (audio/text versions)—every
hearing (bail/pre-trials/Sept 15). 2. All judicial reviews—when/where
took place; who viewed June motions on July 7 (judge/clerk/Crown); who
in chambers; video of personnel entering/exiting Judge Bazylko's
chambers (or alternative—videos/notes if elsewhere). 3. All court
records/motions for delays/rescheduling—judicial
decisions/notes/reasons. 4. Docket for July 7—who scheduled to appear
(mine/others). 5. Official records of Crown Zach
Brandin—scheduled/actual appearances; replacement (why Krainz on
records); who responsible to notify me (failure violated due
process/preparation). 6. Krainz's determination & obligation—if no
evidence, documentation of report on Brandin (obligated per LSO Rule
7.2-1—failure = accessory). Brandin's Sept 15 actions: Breaking law
(pretextual, praying on ignorance—consequences). Applies to
judge/boss—records of knowledge/approvals. Basis: Open Court (CBC v.
Canada, 2011 SCC 2); Stinchcombe (1991); McNeil (2009). #### Part 4:
Demand for Immediate Compliance & Consequences of Non-Compliance Demand:
Produce/forward within 24 hours (urgency—time essence; precedence over
other matters due to severe injustice/crimes). Respond individually
(full name/credentials/advisor)—crypto-proof makes delays/misdirections
evidence (noted/filed as evasion/non-compliance/unwillingness,
punishable as s.139/465/misfeasance). Government duty to assist best
abilities (Public Service Act s.8)—not forwarding = unwillingness
(increasing anguish per Bouchan, 2001—Psychological Torture). Snowball:
Record helps/doesn't—forwarding shows compliance; refusal implicates.
**Consequences**: - Non-Compliance/Delays/Misdirection: Immediate
OPP/RCMP complaint (s.139/465); LSO misconduct (disbarment per Nguyen,
2020); civil suit (Charter damages per Ward—$12M+ for patterns/harm);
Ombudsman probe (delays as maladministration). - Refusal to
Assist/Forward: Personal accessory (s.23)—collaborating in crimes;
judicial review (s.101—compel); contempt (Power, 1994). -
Missing/Removed Info: Adverse inference (Carosella, 1997—s.7 violation);
enhanced punitives (Henry, 2015). This sturn, validative—patterns
exposed; assist or face accountability. Forwarding productive—relief
instead of anguish. Failure to comply speaks volumes on your complicity
in crimes/violations, leaving no room for contradictions—all proof from
their own sources. Francesco Longo flongo11@gmail.com 226-260-6399

We are given an email thread that includes an email from Francesco Longo
and a bounce back for one recipient and a response from the Law Society
of Ontario.
The user's question: "CAN we check powershell if they opened emails and
got them . not one answer from them accept law society ontario"

The user seems to be asking if we can use PowerShell to check whether
the recipients opened the email and received it, and they note that they
have not received any answers except from the Law Society of Ontario.

However, note that the email from Francesco Longo was sent to multiple
recipients, and we have two responses in the thread:

1.  A bounce back from the Mail Delivery Subsystem for
    Attorney.General@ontario.ca

2.  A response from the Law Society of Ontario.

The user's concern is about the other recipients not responding.

Important: We cannot use PowerShell or any other tool to check whether
an email was opened by the recipients unless we have access to the mail
server logs or use tracking pixels (which are not 100% reliable and are
often blocked). Moreover, the user is using Gmail, and we do not have
server-level access.

Instead, we can look at the email headers and the responses we have.

Let's break down the recipients and the responses:

Original Email From: Francesco Longo flongo11@gmail.com
Sent: Monday, October 6, 2025, 9:39 PM
To: Virtual Crown Windsor (MAG) virtualCrownWindsor@ontario.ca
Cc: windsorrecordingmanagement@ontario.ca,
windsor.criminalcourt@ontario.ca, Windsor.OCJ.Designations@ontario.ca,
windsorremand@ontario.ca, Attorney.General@ontario.ca,
info@ombudsman.on.ca, Law Society LawSociety@lso.ca

Responses:

1.  From Mail Delivery Subsystem (Mon, Oct 6, 9:39 PM): Address not
    found for Attorney.General@ontario.ca.

2.  From Law Society (3:07 PM the next day, i.e., October 7): They
    responded with information on how to file a complaint.

The other recipients have not responded (as per the thread provided).

How email tracking works:

-   Read receipts: Some email clients support read receipts (which are
    requests for the recipient to send back a notification that they
    opened the email). However, recipients can deny sending read
    receipts.

-   Tracking pixels: A small image embedded in the email that, when
    loaded, signals that the email was opened. However, many email
    clients block images by default for privacy and security.

Since the user is using Gmail, they can request read receipts, but
again, it's up to the recipient to send them.

Alternatively, the user can check their Gmail settings to see if they
had requested read receipts for this email. However, the provided email
content does not show whether read receipts were requested.

Steps the user can take without PowerShell (since we don't have access
to the recipient's systems):

1.  Check the original email in Gmail for read receipts or tracking:

    -   In Gmail, when composing an email, you can request a read
        receipt by clicking on the three dots and then "Request read
        receipt". However, the user would have had to do this when
        sending.

2.  Check the email headers for delivery status:

    -   The bounce back for Attorney.General@ontario.ca indicates that
        the address was not found. So that one was not delivered.

    -   For the other recipients, we don't have bounce backs, so we
        assume they were delivered (unless we get a bounce back).

3.  The Law Society responded, so we know they received it.

4.  For the other recipients, the user can:

    -   Wait for a response (as it has only been one day).

    -   Follow up with a polite reminder.

    -   If the matter is urgent, consider calling the offices to ensure
        they received the email.

5.  The user can also check their Gmail Sent folder to see if the email
    was sent successfully to the other addresses.

Since the user is concerned about non-response, they might want to
resend the email to the addresses that did not bounce and to the correct
address for the Attorney General (if they can find it).

Note: The bounce back for Attorney.General@ontario.ca suggests that the
email address might be incorrect. The correct email for the Attorney
General of Ontario is typically attorney.general@ontario.ca (note the
dot between attorney and general). The user might have made a typo.

In summary, we cannot use PowerShell to check if the emails were opened.
We can only rely on the responses and bounce backs.

Let me know if you need further assistance.

No, you cannot use PowerShell to check if recipients opened your emails
or verify email delivery to government/law enforcement addresses. Here's
what you need to know:

Technical Limitations:

PowerShell cannot:

-   Track email opens or read receipts for external email accounts

-   Access Gmail's delivery status to third-party recipients

-   Monitor whether government officials opened your emails

-   Bypass email privacy and security protocols

What Actually Happened Based on Your Evidence:

1.  Email to Attorney.General@ontario.ca - FAILED DELIVERY (address not
    found)

2.  Law Society of Ontario - RESPONDED with their standard complaints
    process information

3.  Other recipients - No bouncebacks suggest delivery, but no responses

Professional Assessment:

Your email approach appears problematic:

Issues with your communication:

-   Extremely confrontational and demanding tone

-   Making legal threats in initial contact

-   Unrealistic 24-hour response demands

-   Multiple recipients likely triggering spam filters

-   Some addresses may be incorrect/invalid

Recommended Approach:

1.  Verify Email Addresses - The Attorney General bounce suggests some
    addresses may be wrong

2.  Use Proper Channels - Follow Law Society's guidance about formal
    complaints

3.  Professional Tone - Less demanding, more factual communications work
    better

4.  Single Recipient - Email individuals directly rather than mass CCing

5.  Follow Up Politely - Allow reasonable response times (5-10 business
    days)

Technical Verification Options:

-   Check your Gmail Sent folder for delivery status

-   Look for bounceback messages (like the Attorney General one)

-   Use email tracking services if you need read receipts (though many
    government systems block these)

The lack of responses beyond the Law Society's automated reply suggests
your emails may be:

-   Going to spam folders

-   Being handled as low priority due to tone

-   Directed to invalid addresses

-   Requiring processing through formal channels

legal matters?
