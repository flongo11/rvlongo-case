Of course. The PowerShell commands and investigation strategy you've
provided are for a completely different and highly specific personal
situation. They are not applicable to the Francesco Longo criminal case
file you provided.

Let's refocus on the Longo case. Based on the disclosure documents, here
is a clear, professional summary and analysis.

Case Overview: R. v. Francesco Longo

-   Case Name: R. v. LONGO, FRANCESCO

-   Case/Info Number: 21-845

-   Occurrence Number: 21-38605

-   Lead Investigator: PC Phillip Gratton (Windsor Police Service)

-   Charge: Mischief to Property Over $5000, contrary to Section
    430(1)(a) of the Criminal Code.

Summary of the Allegations

Francesco Longo was a contractor hired by Steve and Hayley Zvaniga in
March 2021 to install an in-ground swimming pool at their home (2948 St.
Clair Ave, Windsor). The agreed price was $22,600, but the victims had
already paid over $23,000 by May 2021, with the pool only 70-80%
complete.

A financial dispute arose. On May 5, 2021, the Zvanigas fired Longo
after he demanded an additional $5,000. They told him to collect his
tools the next evening.

On May 6, 2021, at approximately 12:04 PM, Hayley Zvaniga observed Longo
via her home surveillance system. She saw him arrive at her home, carry
a heavy blue bucket to the pool pump, and return with a sawzall
(reciprocating saw). She heard the sound of cutting, after which Longo
left with the empty bucket and the sawzall.

An inspection revealed that the pool's water lines (leading to the
fountain, filter, and jet) had been freshly cut and filled with wet
cement, causing extensive damage. Police attended, confirmed the damage,
and reviewed the surveillance footage, which corroborated the victim's
account.

Key Evidence in the Disclosure

1.  Victim/Witness Statements:

    -   Hayley Zvaniga: Provided a detailed witness statement and is the
        complainant. She has no criminal record.

    -   Steve Zvaniga: Provided a witness statement and is the
        complainant. He has a dated criminal record (Assault from 1997,
        Fail to Comply from 2001).

2.  Police Reports:

    -   Initial Officer's Report (PC Gratton): Details the initial
        response, observation of the damage, and the civil dispute
        background.

    -   Supplementary Reports: Detail the arrest of Longo at Windsor
        Police Headquarters on May 6, 2021, at 6:10 PM, and the later
        upload of 8 video surveillance clips to the digital evidence
        system in July 2022.

3.  Physical & Digital Evidence:

    -   13 Scene Photos: Documenting the damaged pool lines and cement.

    -   8 Video Clips: The home surveillance footage showing the
        accused's actions. (Note: The system was motion-activated,
        resulting in short clips).

    -   Property Report: Lists the digital evidence.

4.  Accused Information:

    -   Criminal Record: Francesco Longo has one prior conviction for
        Assault (1991).

    -   Release Conditions: He was released on an Undertaking with
        conditions, including:

        -   Not to communicate directly or indirectly with Steve or
            Hayley Zvaniga.

        -   Not to attend 2948 St. Clair Ave or any place the victims
            are known to reside, frequent, or work.

Case Progression & Recent Developments

-   Initial Court Date: Was scheduled for June 16, 2021.

-   Subsequent Court Date (as of July 2022): Was scheduled for October
    20, 2022.

-   Victim's Restitution Request (June 2023): Hayley Zvaniga emailed the
    Crown (Alana) seeking restitution for costs incurred to repair the
    damage. She provided an invoice from "Teknical Konstrux" totalling
    $9,435.50 for repairs (grout, plumbing, labour, etc.), plus
    additional claimed costs for a plumber and lost wages, bringing the
    total sought to over $11,800.

Legal Analysis & Critical Points

-   Strength of the Crown's Case: The case appears strong based on the
    direct observation by the victim via surveillance and the
    corroborating physical evidence. The motive (contractual dispute) is
    clearly established.

-   Key Disclosure Issue: There was a significant delay in uploading the
    crucial video evidence to the disclosure portal—it was not done
    until over a year after the incident (July 2022). This could be a
    point of contention regarding the accused's right to a timely trial
    and full disclosure.

-   Witness Credibility: The defence may seek to use Steve Zvaniga's
    criminal record to challenge his credibility, though the convictions
    are dated.

-   Next Steps: The case appears to be headed towards a resolution,
    either by a guilty plea or a trial. The victim's active pursuit of
    restitution suggests the matter is still before the courts.

In summary, this is a straightforward case of alleged property damage
arising from a failed contractor relationship, with what appears to be
strong direct and circumstantial evidence against the accused.
