KaTeX CSS File for Mathematical Rendering

katex.66a418a9b7.css

CSS 25.04KB

[]

[]

[]

Thought for 15 seconds

[]

We are given a CSS file for KaTeX (a math typesetting library). The task
is to analyze the provided CSS and then answer questions or perform
tasks related to it.

However, the problem statement does not specify what exactly we are to
do with this CSS. Since the file is provided in its entirety, I assume
we might be asked about its contents, such as:

-   What version of KaTeX is this?

-   What fonts are included?

-   How are certain elements styled?

Let me check the version first. In the CSS, there is a line:
.katex .katex-version:after{content:"0.16.21"}

So, the version is 0.16.21.

Now, let's note the fonts included. We can see multiple @font-face rules
for different KaTeX font families, including:

-   KaTeX_AMS

-   KaTeX_Caligraphic (with normal and bold)

-   KaTeX_Fraktur (with normal and bold)

-   KaTeX_Main (with normal, italic, bold, and bold italic)

-   KaTeX_Math (with italic and bold italic)

-   KaTeX_SansSerif (with normal, italic, and bold)

-   KaTeX_Script (normal)

-   KaTeX_Size1, KaTeX_Size2, KaTeX_Size3, KaTeX_Size4 (normal)

-   KaTeX_Typewriter (normal)

Each font is provided in multiple formats (woff2, woff, ttf) and from
specific URLs.

The rest of the CSS defines styles for various mathematical elements and
structures.

If there is a specific question about this CSS, please ask. Otherwise, I
can provide a summary or note any particular points of interest.

This is a CSS file for KaTeX, which is a fast, easy-to-use JavaScript
library for TeX math rendering on the web. Let me break down what this
file contains:

Main Components

1. Font Definitions

The file defines multiple mathematical fonts used by KaTeX:

-   KaTeX_AMS - American Mathematical Society symbols

-   KaTeX_Caligraphic - Calligraphic script (regular and bold)

-   KaTeX_Fraktur - Fraktur/Gothic script (regular and bold)

-   KaTeX_Main - Main text font (regular, italic, bold, bold-italic)

-   KaTeX_Math - Math-specific fonts (italic and bold-italic)

-   KaTeX_SansSerif - Sans-serif fonts

-   KaTeX_Script - Script fonts

-   KaTeX_Size1-4 - Various size variants

-   KaTeX_Typewriter - Monospace fonts

2. Font Sources

Each font is provided in multiple formats for browser compatibility:

-   WOFF2 (modern, compressed)

-   WOFF (widely supported)

-   TTF (TrueType fallback)

3. Mathematical Styling

The CSS includes extensive styling for:

-   Fractions and division lines

-   Radicals (square roots)

-   Accents and limits

-   Matrices and arrays

-   Underlines and overlines

-   Delimiters and brackets

-   Spacing and alignment

4. Responsive Sizing

The file contains multiple font size scaling systems (reset-size1
through reset-size11) to handle different display sizes and mathematical
expressions.

Purpose

This CSS enables KaTeX to render complex mathematical notation with
proper typography, spacing, and alignment that matches traditional
mathematical typesetting standards used in LaTeX.

The file appears to be from KaTeX version 0.16.21 based on the version
indicator in the CSS.

saved_resource.html

HTML 2.38KB

[]

[]

[]

Thought for 121 seconds

[]

We are given an HTML file that seems to be a saved resource from a web
page. The HTML includes:

-   Two script tags loading Intercom (a customer messaging platform) and
    a vendor script.

-   A style tag with CSS classes (prefixed with "go") that are likely
    used by the Intercom widget or another library.

-   The body is empty.

The user's intention is not entirely clear, but since they provided two
files (the KaTeX CSS and this HTML), they might be trying to set up a
page that uses KaTeX for math rendering and Intercom for chat.

However, the HTML does not include any KaTeX related code. Let's assume
the user wants to create a simple page that uses KaTeX to display math
and also has the Intercom chat widget.

Steps to modify the HTML:

1.  We should include the KaTeX CSS that was provided in the first file
    (katex.66a418a9b7.css). Since the user provided the content, we can
    either link to the original KaTeX CSS from a CDN or use the provided
    content by inlining it. However, note that the provided KaTeX CSS
    file is already from a CDN (static.deepseek.com). We can use the
    same link or inline the CSS if the user wants a self-contained
    example.

2.  We need to include the KaTeX JavaScript library to actually render
    the math. The CSS alone is not enough.

3.  We can add a sample math expression to the body to test.

4.  The Intercom scripts are already included, but we might need to
    initialize Intercom with an app ID (which we don't have). So we can
    leave it as is, but note that without an app ID, the Intercom widget
    won't load.

Since the user might not have provided an Intercom app ID, we can focus
on the KaTeX part.

Let's create a simple HTML that:

-   Includes the KaTeX CSS (using the same CDN link as in the provided
    CSS file, but note the provided CSS file is already loaded from a
    CDN, so we can use that link)

-   Includes the KaTeX JS from the same CDN (we can use the standard
    KaTeX CDN)

-   Adds a sample math expression.

However, note: the provided KaTeX CSS file is from static.deepseek.com.
We don't know if DeepSeek hosts the KaTeX JS as well. To be safe, we can
use the official KaTeX CDN for both.

Alternatively, we can use the KaTeX CSS from the same domain as the JS,
but since we don't have the JS from DeepSeek, let's use the official
KaTeX CDN.

We can get the latest KaTeX from: https://katex.org/

We'll use:

-   CSS: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.16.21/dist/katex.min.css

-   JS: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.16.21/dist/katex.min.js

But note: the provided CSS file is version 0.16.21, so we should use the
same version for JS.

However, the user's provided CSS file is not minified and has a
different structure (it's a development build?). The one from the CDN is
minified. It should be compatible.

Let's create the HTML.

Since the user's existing HTML already has a style tag and two scripts,
we can add the KaTeX CSS and JS accordingly.

We have two options for the KaTeX CSS:
Option 1: Use the same CDN as in the provided CSS (static.deepseek.com)
but we don't know if that's public.
Option 2: Use the official KaTeX CDN.

Since the provided CSS from static.deepseek.com is accessible (we can
see the URLs in the CSS are public), we can use that. But note: the
provided CSS file is named katex.66a418a9b7.css which might be a
versioned file. We can use the same base URL for the JS? But we don't
know if DeepSeek hosts the JS.

Alternatively, let's use the official KaTeX CDN for both to avoid any
cross-origin issues and to ensure we have the matching JS.

We'll adjust the HTML:

1.  Add a link to the KaTeX CSS from the official CDN (version 0.16.21)
    in the head.

2.  Add a script tag for KaTeX JS at the end of the body (so it doesn't
    block rendering) and then use it to render math.

But note: the existing HTML already has two scripts in the head. We can
leave them and add KaTeX JS in the body.

3.  Add a sample math expression in the body.

Alternatively, we can use the provided CSS by inlining it? But the CSS
is very long. We can do that if the user wants a single file, but the
instruction says to use the provided files.

Since the user provided two separate files, we can assume they want to
use the provided KaTeX CSS file. But note: the provided KaTeX CSS file
is from static.deepseek.com and we are allowed to use it? We don't know
the user's setup.

Let's assume the user has the KaTeX CSS file locally? The provided file
name is katex.66a418a9b7.css. We can reference it if we are in the same
directory.

But the user didn't specify the context. Since we are in an online
environment, we can use the CDN links.

Given the instructions, I think the user wants to see a working example
with the provided CSS. However, the provided CSS is from a specific
domain (static.deepseek.com) and we don't know if the JS is available
there.

Let's check: The provided CSS uses the following font URLs from
static.deepseek.com. We don't know if the KaTeX JS is hosted there.

To be safe, we can use the KaTeX JS from the official CDN and the CSS
from the provided source (static.deepseek.com) but note: the CSS and JS
versions must match.

Since the provided CSS is for KaTeX 0.16.21, we can use the same version
for JS from the official CDN.

Steps:

1.  In the head, we already have the Intercom scripts and style. We'll
    add a link to the KaTeX CSS from the provided source (the one from
    static.deepseek.com) but note: the provided CSS file is the one we
    have in the first file. We don't have a URL for it, we have the
    content. So we have two options:

    a) If the user has the CSS file hosted at the same location as the
    HTML, we can use a relative path.

    b) We can inline the CSS from the provided content.

2.  We are going to assume that the user has the CSS file in the same
    directory as the HTML and name it katex.66a418a9b7.css. Then we can
    link it.

3.  We'll then include the KaTeX JS from the official CDN (version
    0.16.21) at the end of the body.

4.  We'll add a sample math expression and render it.

Alternatively, if the user does not have the CSS file hosted, we can
inline the entire CSS from the first file. But the CSS is very long
(over 600 lines). We can do that if the user wants a single HTML file.

Since the user provided two files, I think they expect to use the two
files separately.

Let's create the HTML that uses the provided CSS file by linking to it
(assuming it's in the same directory) and then use the KaTeX JS from the
official CDN.

However, note: the provided CSS file in the first message is named
katex.66a418a9b7.css. We can use that.

We'll write:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="katex.66a418a9b7.css">

But wait, the user might have saved the CSS file with that name, so we
are using it.

Now, let's write the HTML.

We'll also note that KaTeX requires the math expressions to be rendered
with either autoRender or manually.

We can use the autoRender feature by including the auto-render
extension.

Alternatively, we can render a single expression manually.

We'll do:

<body> ... existing body (empty) ... We'll add a div with a math
expression.

text

[]

Copy

[]

Download

     Then we'll include the KaTeX JS and the auto-render extension, and then call `renderMathInElement`.

[][]

But note: the provided HTML already has two scripts in the head. We
don't want to break the Intercom functionality, so we'll keep them.

Let's structure:

<head> ... existing head content ... <link rel="stylesheet"
href="katex.66a418a9b7.css"> </head> <body> <div id="math-content"> Here
is an inline math expression: <span
class="math">\frac{\partial}{\partial t}</span> And a display mode math
expression: <div class="math">\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx =
\sqrt{\pi}</div> </div>

text

[]

Copy

[]

Download

     <!-- Existing Intercom scripts (in head) -->

     <!-- KaTeX JS -->
     <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.16.21/dist/katex.min.js"></script>
     <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.16.21/dist/contrib/auto-render.min.js" onload="renderMathInElement(document.body);"></script>

[][]

</body>

But note: the auto-render extension will look for elements with the
class math and render them. We can change the class if we want, but by
default it looks for .math.

However, the default delimiters for auto-render are ...... for inline
and ...... for display. We are using span and div with class math but
without the delimiters. So we have two options:

Option 1: Use the default delimiters in the text and let auto-render
find them.

Option 2: Configure auto-render to also look for elements with class
math and render their content as math.

We can do Option 2 by passing an option to renderMathInElement:

renderMathInElement(document.body, {
delimiters: [
{left: '^(′), right:^(′)′,right:′', display: true},
{left: '$', right: '$', display: false},
{left: '\(', right: '\)', display: false},
{left: '\[', right: '\]', display: true}
],
ignoredClasses: ["skip-math"],
// ... other options ...
});

But note: the auto-render extension by default does not use the class
math as a trigger. It uses the delimiters. So if we want to use the
class math to mark elements, we have to use a different approach.

Alternatively, we can use the katex class and then use the
renderMathInElement without the delimiters? Actually, the auto-render
extension only processes text nodes and looks for delimiters. It does
not, by default, look at the class of an element to decide to render the
entire content as math.

So, if we want to use the class math to mark an element whose entire
content is math, we can do:

We can use the katex class and then use the renderMathInElement with the
ignoredTags and ignoredClasses options, but note: the auto-render
extension is designed to render delimiters in text.

Alternatively, we can use the katex class and then use the katex.render
function on each element. But we don't want to do that manually.

There is another way: we can use the katex class and then use the
auto-render extension with a custom preProcess function that will take
the content of every element with class math and wrap it in a delimiter?
That might be overkill.

Alternatively, we can use the default delimiters and write:

Inline: $\frac{\partial}{\partial t}$∂t∂​
Display:
$\int_{- \infty}^{\infty}e^{- x^{2}}dx = \sqrt{\pi}$∫−∞∞​e−x2dx=π[]​

Then the auto-render will pick them up.

Let's change the example to use the default delimiters.

We'll change the body to:

<body> <p> Here is an inline math expression: \(
\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \) </p> <p> And a display mode math
expression: \[ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi} \] </p>

text

[]

Copy

[]

Download

     ... scripts ...

[][]

</body>

Then the auto-render will work.

But note: the provided HTML already has a body with no content. We are
adding these.

Let's write the full HTML.

However, note: the user might want to use the provided CSS without the
official KaTeX JS? We don't know. We are using the official KaTeX JS
because we don't have the JS from DeepSeek.

We'll assume that the provided CSS is compatible with the official KaTeX
JS of the same version.

Let's write the full HTML.

We are going to:

-   Keep the existing Intercom scripts and style in the head.

-   Add the KaTeX CSS link (using the provided file name) in the head.

-   In the body, add some math examples using the default delimiters.

-   At the end of the body, include the KaTeX JS and the auto-render
    extension from the official CDN (version 0.16.21) and then call
    renderMathInElement on the entire body.

We are using the same version (0.16.21) for JS as the CSS.

Let's do it.

This is an HTML file that appears to be a saved resource, likely from a
web application. Let me break down what I can see:

File Analysis

1. Basic Structure

-   It's a minimal HTML5 document with lang="en"

-   Uses UTF-8 character encoding

-   Saved from about:blank (empty page)

2. External Resources

The file loads several external resources:

Scripts:

-   Intercom CDN scripts (customer messaging platform):

    -   frame-modern.e1a949fd.js

    -   vendor-modern.d7083b47.js

Styles:

-   Embedded CSS with _goober ID (Goober is a minimal CSS-in-JS library)

3. CSS Components

The embedded CSS defines styling for what appears to be
notification/toast components:

-   Snackbar/Toast notifications with different variants:

    -   Default (dark gray background)

    -   Success (green - .go1725278324)

    -   Error (red - .go3651055292)

    -   Warning (orange - .go4215275574)

    -   Info (blue - .go1930647212)

-   Responsive design with media queries for different screen sizes

-   Animation and transitions for smooth appearance

-   Positioning options (top, bottom, left, right, center)

4. Key Features

-   Mobile-responsive design

-   Multiple notification positions

-   Different color schemes for notification types

-   Smooth transitions and animations

-   Shadow effects for depth

-   Flexbox-based layout

5. Empty Body

The <body> tag is completely empty, suggesting this is likely:

-   A template file

-   A saved state of a Single Page Application (SPA)

-   A resource that would be populated dynamically with JavaScript

Purpose

This appears to be part of a web application that uses:

-   Intercom for customer communication

-   Custom notification system for user feedback

-   Modern CSS-in-JS approach with Goober

The file seems to be setting up the foundation for a web app that would
dynamically load content and display notifications to users.
