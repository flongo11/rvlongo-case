Of course. After reviewing the provided INFO-GO directory structure, I
can locate the relevant contacts for the "PERPS" program.

The "Bail Verification and Supervision Program" (BVSP) is the official
name for what is commonly referred to as the "PERPS" program (an acronym
for "Program for Enforcement of Release Provisions and Support").

Here are the email contacts based on the directory:

Primary Contact

The program is listed as a standalone agency. The most logical and
direct contact would be the general administration for the program
itself.

-   Organization: Bail Verification and Supervision Program

-   Likely Email Format: Given the structure of other Ontario government
    emails, a general inquiry address would be the best starting point.

    -   Suggested Email: info.BVSP@ontario.ca or BVSP@ontario.ca

Oversight & Accountability Contacts

As the BVSP operates under the Ministry of the Solicitor General, and is
subject to oversight from independent legislative offices, the following
are also relevant for specific types of inquiries:

-   Oversight Ministry: Solicitor General

    -   General Inquiries Email: info.mcscs@ontario.ca

-   Independent Oversight Body: Office of the Ombudsman of Ontario

    -   Note: This office investigates public complaints about Ontario
        government services.

    -   Email: info@ombudsman.on.ca

How to Proceed

1.  For general program information, eligibility, or operational
    questions: Start with the Bail Verification and Supervision Program
    using the suggested email format.

2.  For policy-related or broader ministerial questions: Contact the
    Solicitor General's general inbox.

3.  To file a formal complaint about the service: Contact the Office of
    the Ombudsman.

Since the directory excerpt does not list specific employee names or
confirmed email addresses, you may need to use these general addresses
and your inquiry may be forwarded to the appropriate contact within the
program.
