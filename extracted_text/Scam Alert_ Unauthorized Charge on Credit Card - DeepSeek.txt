Scam Alert: Unauthorized Charge on Credit Card

[]

[]

[]

CAN YOU CHECK POWER SHELL COMPANY CALL AUDACITY LAUNCHED ON MY PC DOES
NOT OPEN CANT GET RID OF IT AND CHARGED MY CARD 120 DOLLARS

[]

[]

Of course. This is a serious and unfortunately common scam. The company
"Power Shell" (which is a fake name piggybacking on the real Windows
PowerShell) and "Audacity" (which is a legitimate, free, open-source
software) are not the ones who charged you. You have been tricked by a
tech support scam that uses fake pop-ups and fraudulent websites.

Here is a step-by-step guide to get this resolved. Follow these steps in
order.

Step 1: The Most Critical Step - Your Credit Card

Since you were charged $120, this is your top priority.

1.  Call Your Bank/Credit Card Company Immediately: Do this right now.
    Tell them you are a victim of fraud and an unauthorized charge of
    $120 was made to your card. They will cancel the charge, reverse the
    payment, and likely issue you a new card with a new number. This is
    the fastest and most effective way to get your money back.

2.  Do NOT Contact the Scammers: Do not call any phone number provided
    by the pop-up or the software. They will only try to scam you for
    more money.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 2: Uninstall the Malicious Software

The program pretending to be "Power Shell" or "Audacity" is malware.
Here's how to remove it.

Method 1: Through Windows Settings (Standard Uninstall)

1.  Press the Windows Key, type "Apps & features" and press Enter.

2.  In the list of apps, look for the suspicious program. Common scam
    names include:

    -   "Power Shell Pro"

    -   "PC Optimizer Pro"

    -   "Driver Support"

    -   "Audacity Plus" or anything similar.

3.  If you find it, click on it and select Uninstall. Follow any
    prompts.

Method 2: Using Control Panel (Alternative)

1.  Press the Windows Key + R, type "appwiz.cpl" and press Enter.

2.  This opens the classic "Programs and Features" list. Look for the
    malicious program, click on it, and select Uninstall.

Method 3: Use a Proper Malware Scanner (Highly Recommended)

The standard uninstall might not remove everything. You need a dedicated
anti-malware tool.

-   Download and run Malwarebytes Free: It's excellent at removing this
    kind of "PUP" (Potentially Unwanted Program) and adware.

    1.  Go to the official malwarebytes.com website and download the
        free version.

    2.  Install it and run a full scan. It will likely find and
        quarantine the malicious files and any related browser
        extensions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 3: Check and Clean Your Web Browser

These scams often install browser extensions that cause the pop-ups.

-   Google Chrome: Go to chrome://extensions/ and remove any suspicious
    extensions you don't recognize.

-   Microsoft Edge: Go to edge://extensions/ and do the same.

-   Mozilla Firefox: Go to about:addons and check both Extensions and
    Plugins.

Reset Your Browser Homepage and Search Engine:

-   Go into your browser's Settings -> On startup and set it to open a
    specific page (like google.com or a new tab page).

-   In Settings -> Search engine, set your preferred search engine back
    to Google, Bing, etc.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 4: Prevent This From Happening Again

-   Be Extremely Skeptical of Pop-ups: Any pop-up that says your
    computer is infected, your drivers are out of date, or you have won
    a prize is almost always a scam. Never call the number they provide.

-   Only Download from Official Sources: Only get software from the
    official developer's website or the Microsoft Store.

-   The Real Audacity is Free: The genuine Audacity audio editor is 100%
    free and open-source. It would never charge you $120 or show such
    pop-ups. You can get it from audacityteam.org.

-   Windows PowerShell is a System Tool: The real PowerShell is a
    built-in Windows scripting tool. It is not a company and does not
    sell software.

Summary of Your Action Plan:

1.  Call Your Bank/Card Issuer NOW to dispute the $120 charge.

2.  Uninstall the malicious program from Windows Settings.

3.  Download and run Malwarebytes to perform a deep clean.

4.  Remove any suspicious extensions from your web browser.

You have been the victim of a fraudulent scam, but by taking these
steps, you can secure your computer and get your money back.

POWER SHELL NOW

[]

[]

Okay, let's be very clear. "Power Shell" as a company does not exist.
You are dealing with a scam that is illegally using the name of a
legitimate Windows tool to trick you.

The program on your PC is malicious software (malware) designed to scare
you into paying money. The fact that it "does not open" is actually a
good thing – you don't want it to run.

Here is the direct action plan to get rid of it and secure your system.

Step 1: Uninstall the Fake "Power Shell" Program

1.  Press the Windows Key on your keyboard.

2.  Type "Add or Remove Programs" and press Enter.

3.  You will see a list of all your installed applications. Look
    carefully for the scam program. It might be named:

    -   Power Shell (the fake one)

    -   Power Shell Pro

    -   PS Helper

    -   PC Optimizer Pro

    -   Driver Support

    -   Or another suspicious name you don't recognize.

4.  Click on it and select Uninstall. Follow any prompts to remove it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 2: Scan for and Remove All Malware (Crucial Step)

The uninstall might not get everything. You need a dedicated tool to
clean up any leftover files.

1.  Download Malwarebytes Free (from the official website
    malwarebytes.com). This is one of the best tools for this specific
    job.

2.  Install it and open the program.

3.  Click Scan and let it run. It will check your entire system.

4.  When the scan is complete, it will show you a list of threats. Make
    sure everything is checked and click Quarantine.

5.  Restart your computer when prompted.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 3: Check Your Browsers for Malicious Extensions

This scam often uses browser extensions to create pop-ups.

-   In Chrome/Edge: Type chrome://extensions or edge://extensions into
    the address bar.

-   In Firefox: Type about:addons in the address bar.

-   Remove any extensions you did not install yourself or that look
    suspicious (e.g., "PDF Converter," "Search Helper," etc.).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Regarding the $120 Charge - THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART

You were a victim of credit card fraud. You need to act on this
immediately.

1.  Call the phone number on the back of your credit/debit card RIGHT
    NOW.

2.  Tell the representative: "I have an unauthorized fraudulent charge
    on my card for $120 from a tech support scam. I need to dispute this
    charge and get a new card number."

3.  They will guide you through the process, reverse the charge, and
    issue you a new card. This is the only way to get your money back.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Important Reminder:

-   The Real PowerShell: The genuine PowerShell is a built-in Windows
    system tool for administrators. It is not a company and does not
    sell software. It will never pop up asking for money.

-   Do Not Call Any Numbers: Do not contact any phone numbers associated
    with the scam pop-up or the software that charged you. They are
    criminals and will only try to take more money from you.

Your action plan is simple:

1.  Call your bank to reverse the charge.

2.  Uninstall the program from Windows Settings.

3.  Run Malwarebytes to clean up any leftovers.

You can do this. You've been scammed, but by taking these steps, you can
fix your computer and get your money back.

NO WRITE SCRIPT ON POWER SHELL

[]

[]

I understand. You want a script to run in the real Windows PowerShell to
help find and remove the malicious software.

Please be careful: The real PowerShell is a system administration tool.
This script will help you search for the malicious program.

PowerShell Script to Find the Malware

Here's a script that will search for suspicious programs. Copy and paste
this entire code into a real PowerShell window:

powershell

[]

Copy

[]

Download

    # Script to find potentially malicious programs
    Write-Host "Scanning for suspicious programs..." -ForegroundColor Yellow

    # Get all installed programs
    $programs = Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_Product | Select-Object Name, Vendor, Version
    $programs += Get-ItemProperty "HKLM:\Software\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\*" | Select-Object DisplayName, Publisher, DisplayVersion

    # Search for suspicious names
    $suspiciousKeywords = @("Power Shell", "PC Optimizer", "Driver Support", "Audacity", "System Boost", "Registry Clean", "Antivirus", "Security Shield")

    Write-Host "`nChecking installed programs..." -ForegroundColor Cyan
    foreach ($program in $programs) {
        foreach ($keyword in $suspiciousKeywords) {
            if ($program.Name -like "*$keyword*" -or $program.DisplayName -like "*$keyword*") {
                Write-Host "SUSPICIOUS PROGRAM FOUND: $($program.Name ?? $program.DisplayName)" -ForegroundColor Red
                Write-Host "  Vendor: $($program.Vendor ?? $program.Publisher)" -ForegroundColor Yellow
                Write-Host "  Version: $($program.Version ?? $program.DisplayVersion)" -ForegroundColor Yellow
                Write-Host ""
            }
        }
    }

    # Check for recently running suspicious processes
    Write-Host "`nChecking for suspicious processes..." -ForegroundColor Cyan
    Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.ProcessName -like "*power*" -or $_.ProcessName -like "*audacity*" -or $_.ProcessName -like "*support*"} | Format-Table ProcessName, ID -AutoSize

    Write-Host "Scan complete. Check the RED items above." -ForegroundColor Green
    Write-Host "`nTo remove any suspicious program, go to:" -ForegroundColor White
    Write-Host "Windows Settings -> Apps -> Apps & features" -ForegroundColor White
    Write-Host "Find the program in the list and click Uninstall" -ForegroundColor White

-   They will reverse the charge and send you a new card

The PowerShell script will help find the malware, but calling your bank
