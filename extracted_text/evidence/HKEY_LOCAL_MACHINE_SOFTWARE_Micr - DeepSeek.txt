consists of counters that apply to more than one instance of a component
processors on the computer.\05\0The Memory performance object consists
of counters that describe the behavior of physical and virtual memory on
the computer. Physical memory is the amount of random access memory on
the computer. Virtual memory consists of the space in physical memory
and on disk. Many of the memory counters monitor paging, which is the
movement of pages of code and data between disk and physical memory.
Excessive paging, a symptom of a memory shortage, can cause delays which
interfere with all system processes.\07\0% Processor Time is the
percentage of elapsed time that the processor spends to execute a
non-Idle thread. It is calculated by measuring the percentage of time
that the processor spends executing the idle thread and then subtracting
that value from 100%. (Each processor has an idle thread that consumes
cycles when no other threads are ready to run). This counter is the
primary indicator of processor activity, and displays the average
percentage of busy time observed during the sample interval. It should
be noted that the accounting calculation of whether the processor is
idle is performed at an internal sampling interval of the system clock
(10ms). On todays fast processors, % Processor Time can therefore
underestimate the processor utilization as the processor may be spending
a lot of time servicing threads between the system clock sampling
interval. Workload based timer applications are one example of
applications which are more likely to be measured inaccurately as timers
are signaled just after the sample is taken.\09\0% Total DPC Time is the
average percentage of time that all processors spend receiving and
servicing deferred procedure calls (DPCs). (DPCs are interrupts that run
at a lower priority than the standard interrupts). It is the sum of
Processor: % DPC Time for all processors on the computer, divided by the
number of processors. System: % Total DPC Time is a component of System:
% Total Privileged Time because DPCs are executed in privileged mode.
DPCs are counted separately and are not a component of the interrupt
count. This counter displays the average busy time as a percentage of
the sample time.\011\0File Read Operations/sec is the combined rate of
file system read requests to all devices on the computer, including
requests to read from the file system cache. It is measured in numbers
of reads. This counter displays the difference between the values
observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample
interval.\013\0File Write Operations/sec is the combined rate of the
file system write requests to all devices on the computer, including
requests to write to data in the file system cache. It is measured in
numbers of writes. This counter displays the difference between the
values observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the
sample interval.\015\0File Control Operations/sec is the combined rate
of file system operations that are neither reads nor writes, such as
file system control requests and requests for information about device
characteristics or status. This is the inverse of System: File Data
Operations/sec and is measured in number of operations perf second. This
counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last
two samples, divided by the duration of the sample interval.\017\0File
Read Bytes/sec is the overall rate at which bytes are read to satisfy
file system read requests to all devices on the computer, including
reads from the file system cache. It is measured in number of bytes per
second. This counter displays the difference between the values observed
in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample
interval.\019\0File Write Bytes/sec is the overall rate at which bytes
are written to satisfy file system write requests to all devices on the
computer, including writes to the file system cache. It is measured in
number of bytes per second. This counter displays the difference between
the values observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of
the sample interval.\021\0File Control Bytes/sec is the overall rate at
which bytes are transferred for all file system operations that are
neither reads nor writes, including file system control requests and
requests for information about device characteristics or status. It is
measured in numbers of bytes. This counter displays the difference
between the values observed in the last two samples, divided by the
duration of the sample interval.\023\0% Total Interrupt Time is the
average percentage of time that all processors spend receiving and
servicing hardware interrupts during sample intervals, where the value
is an indirect indicator of the activity of devices that generate
interrupts. It is the sum of Processor: % Interrupt Time for of all
processors on the computer, divided by the number of processors. DPCs
are counted separately and are not a component of the interrupt count.
This value is an indirect indicator of the activity of devices that
generate interrupts, such as the system timer, the mouse, disk drivers,
data communication lines, network interface cards and other peripheral
devices.\025\0Available Bytes is the amount of physical memory, in
bytes, immediately available for allocation to a process or for system
use. It is equal to the sum of memory assigned to the standby (cached),
free and zero page lists.\027\0Committed Bytes is the amount of
committed virtual memory, in bytes. Committed memory is the physical
memory which has space reserved on the disk paging file(s). There can be
one or more paging files on each physical drive. This counter displays
the last observed value only; it is not an average.\029\0Page Faults/sec
is the average number of pages faulted per second. It is measured in
number of pages faulted per second because only one page is faulted in
each fault operation, hence this is also equal to the number of page
fault operations. This counter includes both hard faults (those that
require disk access) and soft faults (where the faulted page is found
elsewhere in physical memory.) Most processors can handle large numbers
of soft faults without significant consequence. However, hard faults,
which require disk access, can cause significant delays.\031\0Commit
Limit is the amount of virtual memory that can be committed without
having to extend the paging file(s). It is measured in bytes. Committed
memory is the physical memory which has space reserved on the disk
paging files. There can be one paging file on each logical drive). If
the paging file(s) are be expanded, this limit increases accordingly.
This counter displays the last observed value only; it is not an
average.\033\0Write Copies/sec is the rate at which page faults are
caused by attempts to write that have been satisfied by coping of the
page from elsewhere in physical memory. This is an economical way of
sharing data since pages are only copied when they are written to;
otherwise, the page is shared. This counter shows the number of copies,
without regard for the number of pages copied in each
operation.\035\0Transition Faults/sec is the rate at which page faults
are resolved by recovering pages that were being used by another process
sharing the page, or were on the modified page list or the standby list,
or were being written to disk at the time of the page fault. The pages
were recovered without additional disk activity. Transition faults are
counted in numbers of faults; because only one page is faulted in each
operation, it is also equal to the number of pages faulted.\037\0Cache
Faults/sec is the rate at which faults occur when a page sought in the
file system cache is not found and must be retrieved from elsewhere in
memory (a soft fault) or from disk (a hard fault). The file system cache
is an area of physical memory that stores recently used pages of data
for applications. Cache activity is a reliable indicator of most
application I/O operations. This counter shows the number of faults,
without regard for the number of pages faulted in each
operation.\039\0Demand Zero Faults/sec is the rate at which a zeroed
page is required to satisfy the fault. Zeroed pages, pages emptied of
previously stored data and filled with zeros, are a security feature of
Windows that prevent processes from seeing data stored by earlier
processes that used the memory space. Windows maintains a list of zeroed
pages to accelerate this process. This counter shows the number of
faults, without regard to the number of pages retrieved to satisfy the
fault. This counter displays the difference between the values observed
in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample
interval.\041\0Pages/sec is the rate at which pages are read from or
written to disk to resolve hard page faults. This counter is a primary
indicator of the kinds of faults that cause system-wide delays. It is
the sum of Memory\\Pages Input/sec and Memory\\Pages Output/sec. It is
counted in numbers of pages, so it can be compared to other counts of
pages, such as Memory\\Page Faults/sec, without conversion. It includes
pages retrieved to satisfy faults in the file system cache (usually
requested by applications) non-cached mapped memory files.\043\0Page
Reads/sec is the rate at which the disk was read to resolve hard page
faults. It shows the number of reads operations, without regard to the
number of pages retrieved in each operation. Hard page faults occur when
a process references a page in virtual memory that is not in working set
or elsewhere in physical memory, and must be retrieved from disk. This
counter is a primary indicator of the kinds of faults that cause
system-wide delays. It includes read operations to satisfy faults in the
file system cache (usually requested by applications) and in non-cached
mapped memory files. Compare the value of Memory\\Pages Reads/sec to the
value of Memory\\Pages Input/sec to determine the average number of
pages read during each operation.\045\0Processor Queue Length is the
number of threads in the processor queue. Unlike the disk counters, this
counter counters, this counter shows ready threads only, not threads
that are running. There is a single queue for processor time even on
computers with multiple processors. Therefore, if a computer has
multiple processors, you need to divide this value by the number of
processors servicing the workload. A sustained processor queue of less
than 10 threads per processor is normally acceptable, dependent of the
workload.\047\0Thread State is the current state of the thread. It is 0
for Initialized, 1 for Ready, 2 for Running, 3 for Standby, 4 for
Terminated, 5 for Wait, 6 for Transition, 7 for Unknown. A Running
thread is using a processor; a Standby thread is about to use one. A
Ready thread wants to use a processor, but is waiting for a processor
because none are free. A thread in Transition is waiting for a resource
in order to execute, such as waiting for its execution stack to be paged
in from disk. A Waiting thread has no use for the processor because it
is waiting for a peripheral operation to complete or a resource to
become free.\049\0Pages Output/sec is the rate at which pages are
written to disk to free up space in physical memory. Pages are written
back to disk only if they are changed in physical memory, so they are
likely to hold data, not code. A high rate of pages output might
indicate a memory shortage. Windows writes more pages back to disk to
free up space when physical memory is in short supply. This counter
shows the number of pages, and can be compared to other counts of pages,
without conversion.\051\0Page Writes/sec is the rate at which pages are
written to disk to free up space in physical memory. Pages are written
to disk only if they are changed while in physical memory, so they are
likely to hold data, not code. This counter shows write operations,
without regard to the number of pages written in each operation. This
counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last
two samples, divided by the duration of the sample interval.\053\0The
Browser performance object consists of counters that measure the rates
of announcements, enumerations, and other Browser
transmissions.\055\0Announcements Server/sec is the rate at which the
servers in this domain have announced themselves to this
server.\057\0Pool Paged Bytes is the size, in bytes, of the paged pool,
an area of the system virtual memory that is used for objects that can
be written to disk when they are not being used. Memory\\Pool Paged
Bytes is calculated differently than Process\\Pool Paged Bytes, so it
might not equal Process(_Total)\\Pool Paged Bytes. This counter displays
the last observed value only; it is not an average.\059\0Pool Nonpaged
Bytes is the size, in bytes, of the nonpaged pool, an area of the system
virtual memory that is used for objects that cannot be written to disk,
but must remain in physical memory as long as they are allocated.
Memory\\Pool Nonpaged Bytes is calculated differently than Process\\Pool
Nonpaged Bytes, so it might not equal Process(_Total)\\Pool Nonpaged
Bytes. This counter displays the last observed value only; it is not an
average.\061\0Pool Paged Allocs is the number of calls to allocate space
in the paged pool. The paged pool is an area of the system virtual
memory that is used for objects that can be written to disk when they
are not being used. It is measured in numbers of calls to allocate
space, regardless of the amount of space allocated in each call. This
counter displays the last observed value only; it is not an
average.\063\0Pool Paged Resident Bytes is the size, in bytes, of the
portion of the paged pool that is currently resident and active in
physical memory. The paged pool is an area of the system virtual memory
that is used for objects that can be written to disk when they are not
being used. This counter displays the last observed value only; it is
not an average.\065\0Pool Nonpaged Allocs is the number of calls to
allocate space in the nonpaged pool. The nonpaged pool is an area of
system memory area for objects that cannot be written to disk, and must
remain in physical memory as long as they are allocated. It is measured
in numbers of calls to allocate space, regardless of the amount of space
allocated in each call. This counter displays the last observed value
only; it is not an average.\067\0Bytes Total/sec is the total rate of
bytes sent to or received from the network by the protocol, but only for
the frames (packets) which carry data. This is the sum of Frame
Bytes/sec and Datagram Bytes/sec.\069\0System Code Total Bytes is the
size, in bytes, of the pageable operating system code currently mapped
into the system virtual address space. This value is calculated by
summing the bytes in Ntoskrnl.exe, Hal.dll, the boot drivers, and file
systems loaded by Ntldr/osloader. This counter does not include code
that must remain in physical memory and cannot be written to disk. This
counter displays the last observed value only; it is not an
average.\071\0System Code Resident Bytes is the size, in bytes, of the
pageable operating system code that is currently resident and active in
physical memory. This value is a component of Memory\\System Code Total
Bytes. Memory\\System Code Resident Bytes (and Memory\\System Code Total
Bytes) does not include code that must remain in physical memory and
cannot be written to disk. This counter displays the last observed value
only; it is not an average.\073\0System Driver Total Bytes is the size,
in bytes, of the pageable virtual memory currently being used by device
drivers. Pageable memory can be written to disk when it is not being
used. It includes both physical memory (Memory\\System Driver Resident
Bytes) and code and data paged to disk. It is a component of
Memory\\System Code Total Bytes. This counter displays the last observed
value only; it is not an average.\075\0System Driver Resident Bytes is
the size, in bytes, of the pageable physical memory being used by device
drivers. It is the working set (physical memory area) of the drivers.
This value is a component of Memory\\System Driver Total Bytes, which
also includes driver memory that has been written to disk. Neither
Memory\\System Driver Resident Bytes nor Memory\\System Driver Total
Bytes includes memory that cannot be written to disk.\077\0System Cache
Resident Bytes is the size, in bytes, of the portion of the system file
cache which is currently resident and active in physical memory. The
System Cache Resident Bytes and Memory\\Cache Bytes counters are
equivalent. This counter displays the last observed value only; it is
not an average.\079\0Announcements Domain/sec is the rate at which a
domain has announced itself to the network.\081\0Election Packets/sec is
the rate at which browser election packets have been received by this
workstation.\083\0Mailslot Writes/sec is the rate at which mailslot
messages have been successfully received.\085\0Server List Requests/sec
is the rate at which requests to retrieve a list of browser servers have
been processed by this workstation.\087\0The Cache performance object
consists of counters that monitor the file system cache, an area of
physical memory that stores recently used data as long as possible to
permit access to the data without having to read from the disk. Because
applications typically use the cache, the cache is monitored as an
indicator of application I/O operations. When memory is plentiful, the
cache can grow, but when memory is scarce, the cache can become too
small to be effective.\089\0Data Maps/sec is the frequency that a file
system such as NTFS, maps a page of a file into the file system cache to
read the page.\091\0Sync Data Maps/sec counts the frequency that a file
system, such as NTFS, maps a page of a file into the file system cache
to read the page, and wishes to wait for the page to be retrieved if it
is not in main memory.\093\0Async Data Maps/sec is the frequency that an
application using a file system, such as NTFS, to map a page of a file
into the file system cache to read the page, and does not wait for the
page to be retrieved if it is not in main memory.\095\0Data Map Hits is
the percentage of data maps in the file system cache that could be
resolved without having to retrieve a page from the disk, because the
page was already in physical memory.\097\0Data Map Pins/sec is the
frequency of data maps in the file system cache that resulted in pinning
a page in main memory, an action usually preparatory to writing to the
file on disk. While pinned, a page's physical address in main memory and
virtual address in the file system cache will not be altered.\099\0Pin
Reads/sec is the frequency of reading data into the file system cache
preparatory to writing the data back to disk. Pages read in this fashion
are pinned in memory at the completion of the read. While pinned, a
page's physical address in the file system cache will not be
altered.\0101\0Sync Pin Reads/sec is the frequency of reading data into
the file system cache preparatory to writing the data back to disk.
Pages read in this fashion are pinned in memory at the completion of the
read. The file system will not regain control until the page is pinned
in the file system cache, in particular if the disk must be accessed to
retrieve the page. While pinned, a page's physical address in the file
system cache will not be altered.\0103\0Async Pin Reads/sec is the
frequency of reading data into the file system cache preparatory to
writing the data back to disk. Pages read in this fashion are pinned in
memory at the completion of the read. The file system will regain
control immediately even if the disk must be accessed to retrieve the
page. While pinned, a page's physical address will not be
altered.\0105\0Pin Read Hits is the percentage of pin read requests that
hit the file system cache, i.e., did not require a disk read in order to
provide access to the page in the file system cache. While pinned, a
page's physical address in the file system cache will not be altered.
The LAN Redirector uses this method for retrieving data from the cache,
as does the LAN Server for small transfers. This is usually the method
used by the disk file systems as well.\0107\0Copy Reads/sec is the
frequency of reads from pages of the file system cache that involve a
memory copy of the data from the cache to the application's buffer. The
LAN Redirector uses this method for retrieving information from the file
system cache, as does the LAN Server for small transfers. This is a
method used by the disk file systems as well.\0109\0Sync Copy Reads/sec
is the frequency of reads from pages of the file system cache that
involve a memory copy of the data from the cache to the application's
buffer. The file system will not regain control until the copy operation
is complete, even if the disk must be accessed to retrieve the
page.\0111\0Async Copy Reads/sec is the frequency of reads from pages of
the file system cache that involve a memory copy of the data from the
cache to the application's buffer. The application will regain control
immediately even if the disk must be accessed to retrieve the
page.\0113\0Copy Read Hits is the percentage of cache copy read requests
that hit the cache, that is, they did not require a disk read in order
to provide access to the page in the cache. A copy read is a file read
operation that is satisfied by a memory copy from a page in the cache to
the application's buffer. The LAN Redirector uses this method for
retrieving information from the cache, as does the LAN Server for small
transfers. This is a method used by the disk file systems as
well.\0115\0MDL Reads/sec is the frequency of reads from the file system
cache that use a Memory Descriptor List (MDL) to access the data. The
MDL contains the physical address of each page involved in the transfer,
and thus can employ a hardware Direct Memory Access (DMA) device to
effect the copy. The LAN Server uses this method for large transfers out
of the server.\0117\0Sync MDL Reads/sec is the frequency of reads from
the file system cache that use a Memory Descriptor List (MDL) to access
the pages. The MDL contains the physical address of each page in the
transfer, thus permitting Direct Memory Access (DMA) of the pages. If
the accessed page(s) are not in main memory, the caller will wait for
the pages to fault in from the disk.\0119\0Async MDL Reads/sec is the
frequency of reads from the file system cache that use a Memory
Descriptor List (MDL) to access the pages. The MDL contains the physical
address of each page in the transfer, thus permitting Direct Memory
Access (DMA) of the pages. If the accessed page(s) are not in main
memory, the calling application program will not wait for the pages to
fault in from disk.\0121\0MDL Read Hits is the percentage of Memory
Descriptor List (MDL) Read requests to the file system cache that hit
the cache, i.e., did not require disk accesses in order to provide
memory access to the page(s) in the cache.\0123\0Read Aheads/sec is the
frequency of reads from the file system cache in which the Cache detects
sequential access to a file. The read aheads permit the data to be
transferred in larger blocks than those being requested by the
application, reducing the overhead per access.\0125\0Fast Reads/sec is
the frequency of reads from the file system cache that bypass the
installed file system and retrieve the data directly from the cache.
Normally, file I/O requests invoke the appropriate file system to
retrieve data from a file, but this path permits direct retrieval of
data from the cache without file system involvement if the data is in
the cache. Even if the data is not in the cache, one invocation of the
file system is avoided.\0127\0Sync Fast Reads/sec is the frequency of
reads from the file system cache that bypass the installed file system
and retrieve the data directly from the cache. Normally, file I/O
requests invoke the appropriate file system to retrieve data from a
file, but this path permits direct retrieval of data from the cache
without file system involvement if the data is in the cache. Even if the
data is not in the cache, one invocation of the file system is avoided.
If the data is not in the cache, the request (application program call)
will wait until the data has been retrieved from disk.\0129\0Async Fast
Reads/sec is the frequency of reads from the file system cache that
bypass the installed file system and retrieve the data directly from the
cache. Normally, file I/O requests will invoke the appropriate file
system to retrieve data from a file, but this path permits data to be
retrieved from the cache directly (without file system involvement) if
the data is in the cache. Even if the data is not in the cache, one
invocation of the file system is avoided. If the data is not in the
cache, the request (application program call) will not wait until the
data has been retrieved from disk, but will get control
immediately.\0131\0Fast Read Resource Misses/sec is the frequency of
cache misses necessitated by the lack of available resources to satisfy
the request.\0133\0Fast Read Not Possibles/sec is the frequency of
attempts by an Application Program Interface (API) function call to
bypass the file system to get to data in the file system cache that
could not be honored without invoking the file system.\0135\0Lazy Write
Flushes/sec is the rate at which the Lazy Writer thread has written to
disk. Lazy Writing is the process of updating the disk after the page
has been changed in memory, so that the application that changed the
file does not have to wait for the disk write to be complete before
proceeding. More than one page can be transferred by each write
operation.\0137\0Lazy Write Pages/sec is the rate at which the Lazy
Writer thread has written to disk. Lazy Writing is the process of
updating the disk after the page has been changed in memory, so that the
application that changed the file does not have to wait for the disk
write to be complete before proceeding. More than one page can be
transferred on a single disk write operation.\0139\0Data Flushes/sec is
the rate at which the file system cache has flushed its contents to disk
as the result of a request to flush or to satisfy a write-through file
write request. More than one page can be transferred on each flush
operation.\0141\0Data Flush Pages/sec is the number of pages the file
system cache has flushed to disk as a result of a request to flush or to
satisfy a write-through file write request. More than one page can be
transferred on each flush operation.\0143\0% User Time is the percentage
of elapsed time the processor spends in the user mode. User mode is a
restricted processing mode designed for applications, environment
subsystems, and integral subsystems. The alternative, privileged mode,
is designed for operating system components and allows direct access to
hardware and all memory. The operating system switches application
threads to privileged mode to access operating system services. This
counter displays the average busy time as a percentage of the sample
time.\0145\0% Privileged Time is the percentage of elapsed time that the
process threads spent executing code in privileged mode. When a Windows
system service in called, the service will often run in privileged mode
to gain access to system-private data. Such data is protected from
access by threads executing in user mode. Calls to the system can be
explicit or implicit, such as page faults or interrupts. Unlike some
early operating systems, Windows uses process boundaries for subsystem
protection in addition to the traditional protection of user and
privileged modes. Some work done by Windows on behalf of the application
might appear in other subsystem processes in addition to the privileged
time in the process.\0147\0Context Switches/sec is the combined rate at
which all processors on the computer are switched from one thread to
another. Context switches occur when a running thread voluntarily
relinquishes the processor, is preempted by a higher priority ready
thread, or switches between user-mode and privileged (kernel) mode to
use an Executive or subsystem service. It is the sum of Thread\\Context
Switches/sec for all threads running on all processors in the computer
and is measured in numbers of switches. There are context switch
counters on the System and Thread objects. This counter displays the
difference between the values observed in the last two samples, divided
by the duration of the sample interval.\0149\0Interrupts/sec is the
average rate, in incidents per second, at which the processor received
and serviced hardware interrupts. It does not include deferred procedure
calls (DPCs), which are counted separately. This value is an indirect
indicator of the activity of devices that generate interrupts, such as
the system clock, the mouse, disk drivers, data communication lines,
network interface cards, and other peripheral devices. These devices
normally interrupt the processor when they have completed a task or
require attention. Normal thread execution is suspended. The system
clock typically interrupts the processor every 10 milliseconds, creating
a background of interrupt activity. This counter displays the difference
between the values observed in the last two samples, divided by the
duration of the sample interval.\0151\0System Calls/sec is the combined
rate of calls to operating system service routines by all processes
running on the computer. These routines perform all of the basic
scheduling and synchronization of activities on the computer, and
provide access to non-graphic devices, memory management, and name space
management. This counter displays the difference between the values
observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample
interval.\0153\0Level 1 TLB Fills/sec is the frequency of faults that
occur when reference is made to memory whose Page Table Entry (PTE) is
not in the Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB). On some computers this
fault is handled by software loading the PTE into the TLB, and this
counter is incremented.\0155\0Level 2 TLB Fills/sec is the frequency of
faults that occur when reference is made to memory whose Page Table
Entry (PTE) is not in the Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB), nor is the
page containing the PTE. On some computers this fault is handled by
software loading the PTE into the TLB, and this counter is
incremented.\0157\0% User Time is the percentage of elapsed time that
the process threads spent executing code in user mode. Applications,
environment subsystems, and integral subsystems execute in user mode.
Code executing in user mode cannot damage the integrity of the Windows
executive, kernel, and device drivers. Unlike some early operating
systems, Windows uses process boundaries for subsystem protection in
addition to the traditional protection of user and privileged modes.
Some work done by Windows on behalf of the application might appear in
other subsystem processes in addition to the privileged time in the
process.\0159\0% Privileged Time is the percentage of elapsed time that
the process threads spent executing code in privileged mode. When a
Windows system service is called, the service will often run in
privileged mode to gain access to system-private data. Such data is
protected from access by threads executing in user mode. Calls to the
system can be explicit or implicit, such as page faults or interrupts.

subsystem protection in addition to the traditional protection of user
and privileged modes. Some work done by Windows on behalf of the
application might appear in other subsystem processes in addition to the
privileged time in the process.\0161\0Enumerations Server/sec is the
rate at which server browse requests have been processed by this
workstation.\0163\0Enumerations Domain/sec is the rate at which domain
browse requests have been processed by this
workstation.\0165\0Enumerations Other/sec is the rate at which browse
requests processed by this workstation are not domain or server browse
requests.\0167\0Missed Server Announcements is the number of server
announcements that have been missed due to configuration or allocation
limits.\0169\0Missed Mailslot Datagrams is the number of Mailslot
Datagrams that have been discarded due to configuration or allocation
limits.\0171\0Missed Server List Requests is the number of requests to
retrieve a list of browser servers that were received by this
workstation, but could not be processed.\0173\0Virtual Bytes Peak is the
maximum size, in bytes, of virtual address space the process has used at
any one time. Use of virtual address space does not necessarily imply
corresponding use of either disk or main memory pages. However, virtual
space is finite, and the process might limit its ability to load
libraries.\0175\0Virtual Bytes is the current size, in bytes, of the
virtual address space the process is using. Use of virtual address space
does not necessarily imply corresponding use of either disk or main
memory pages. Virtual space is finite, and the process can limit its
ability to load libraries.\0177\0Page Faults/sec is the rate at which
page faults by the threads executing in this process are occurring. A
page fault occurs when a thread refers to a virtual memory page that is
not in its working set in main memory. This may not cause the page to be
fetched from disk if it is on the standby list and hence already in main
memory, or if it is in use by another process with whom the page is
shared.\0179\0Working Set Peak is the maximum size, in bytes, of the
Working Set of this process at any point in time. The Working Set is the
set of memory pages touched recently by the threads in the process. If
free memory in the computer is above a threshold, pages are left in the
Working Set of a process even if they are not in use. When free memory
falls below a threshold, pages are trimmed from Working Sets. If they
are needed they will then be soft-faulted back into the Working Set
before they leave main memory.\0181\0Working Set is the current size, in
bytes, of the Working Set of this process. The Working Set is the set of
memory pages touched recently by the threads in the process. If free
memory in the computer is above a threshold, pages are left in the
Working Set of a process even if they are not in use. When free memory
falls below a threshold, pages are trimmed from Working Sets. If they
are needed they will then be soft-faulted back into the Working Set
before leaving main memory.\0183\0Page File Bytes Peak is the maximum
amount of virtual memory, in bytes, that this process has reserved for
use in the paging file(s). Paging files are used to store pages of
memory used by the process that are not contained in other files. Paging
files are shared by all processes, and the lack of space in paging files
can prevent other processes from allocating memory. If there is no
paging file, this counter reflects the maximum amount of virtual memory
that the process has reserved for use in physical memory.\0185\0Page
File Bytes is the current amount of virtual memory, in bytes, that this
process has reserved for use in the paging file(s). Paging files are
used to store pages of memory used by the process that are not contained
in other files. Paging files are shared by all processes, and the lack
of space in paging files can prevent other processes from allocating
memory. If there is no paging file, this counter reflects the current
amount of virtual memory that the process has reserved for use in
physical memory.\0187\0Private Bytes is the current size, in bytes, of
memory that this process has allocated that cannot be shared with other
processes.\0189\0% Processor Time is the percentage of elapsed time that
all of process threads used the processor to execution instructions. An
instruction is the basic unit of execution in a computer, a thread is
the object that executes instructions, and a process is the object
created when a program is run. Code executed to handle some hardware
interrupts and trap conditions are included in this count.\0191\0%
Processor Time is the percentage of elapsed time that all of process
threads used the processor to execution instructions. An instruction is
the basic unit of execution in a computer, a thread is the object that
executes instructions, and a process is the object created when a
program is run. Code executed to handle some hardware interrupts and
trap conditions are included in this count.\0193\0% User Time is the
percentage of elapsed time that this thread has spent executing code in
user mode. Applications, environment subsystems, and integral subsystems
execute in user mode. Code executing in user mode cannot damage the
integrity of the Windows NT Executive, Kernel, and device drivers.
Unlike some early operating systems, Windows NT uses process boundaries
for subsystem protection in addition to the traditional protection of
user and privileged modes. These subsystem processes provide additional
protection. Therefore, some work done by Windows NT on behalf of your
application might appear in other subsystem processes in addition to the
privileged time in your process.\0195\0% Privileged Time is the
percentage of elapsed time that the process threads spent executing code
in privileged mode. When a Windows system service in called, the service
will often run in privileged mode to gain access to system-private data.
Such data is protected from access by threads executing in user mode.
Calls to the system can be explicit or implicit, such as page faults or
interrupts. Unlike some early operating systems, Windows uses process
boundaries for subsystem protection in addition to the traditional
protection of user and privileged modes. Some work done by Windows on
behalf of the application might appear in other subsystem processes in
addition to the privileged time in the process.\0197\0Context
Switches/sec is the rate of switches from one thread to another. Thread
switches can occur either inside of a single process or across
processes. A thread switch can be caused either by one thread asking
another for information, or by a thread being preempted by another,
higher priority thread becoming ready to run. Unlike some early
operating systems, Windows NT uses process boundaries for subsystem
protection in addition to the traditional protection of user and
privileged modes. These subsystem processes provide additional
protection. Therefore, some work done by Windows NT on behalf of an
application appear in other subsystem processes in addition to the
privileged time in the application. Switching to the subsystem process
causes one Context Switch in the application thread. Switching back
causes another Context Switch in the subsystem thread.\0199\0Current
Disk Queue Length is the number of requests outstanding on the disk at
the time the performance data is collected. It also includes requests in
service at the time of the collection. This is a instantaneous snapshot,
not an average over the time interval. Multi-spindle disk devices can
have multiple requests that are active at one time, but other concurrent
requests are awaiting service. This counter might reflect a transitory
high or low queue length, but if there is a sustained load on the disk
drive, it is likely that this will be consistently high. Requests
experience delays proportional to the length of this queue minus the
number of spindles on the disks. For good performance, this difference
should average less than two.\0201\0% Disk Time is the percentage of
elapsed time that the selected disk drive was busy servicing read or
write requests.\0203\0% Disk Read Time is the percentage of elapsed time
that the selected disk drive was busy servicing read requests.\0205\0%
Disk Write Time is the percentage of elapsed time that the selected disk
drive was busy servicing write requests.\0207\0Avg. Disk sec/Transfer is
the time, in seconds, of the average disk transfer.\0209\0Avg. Disk
sec/Read is the average time, in seconds, of a read of data from the
disk.\0211\0Avg. Disk sec/Write is the average time, in seconds, of a
write of data to the disk.\0213\0Disk Transfers/sec is the rate of read
and write operations on the disk.\0215\0Disk Reads/sec is the rate of
read operations on the disk.\0217\0Disk Writes/sec is the rate of write
operations on the disk.\0219\0Disk Bytes/sec is the rate bytes are
transferred to or from the disk during write or read
operations.\0221\0Disk Read Bytes/sec is the rate at which bytes are
transferred from the disk during read operations.\0223\0Disk Write
Bytes/sec is rate at which bytes are transferred to the disk during
write operations.\0225\0Avg. Disk Bytes/Transfer is the average number
of bytes transferred to or from the disk during write or read
operations.\0227\0Avg. Disk Bytes/Read is the average number of bytes
transferred from the disk during read operations.\0229\0Avg. Disk
Bytes/Write is the average number of bytes transferred to the disk
during write operations.\0231\0The Process performance object consists
of counters that monitor running application program and system
processes. All the threads in a process share the same address space and
have access to the same data.\0233\0The Thread performance object
consists of counters that measure aspects of thread behavior. A thread
is the basic object that executes instructions on a processor. All
running processes have at least one thread.\0235\0The Physical Disk
performance object consists of counters that monitor hard or fixed disk
drive on a computer. Disks are used to store file, program, and paging
data and are read to retrieve these items, and written to record changes
to them. The values of physical disk counters are sums of the values of
the logical disks (or partitions) into which they are divided.\0237\0The
Logical Disk performance object consists of counters that monitor
logical partitions of a hard or fixed disk drives. Performance Monitor
identifies logical disks by their a drive letter, such as C.\0239\0The
Processor performance object consists of counters that measure aspects
of processor activity. The processor is the part of the computer that
performs arithmetic and logical computations, initiates operations on
peripherals, and runs the threads of processes. A computer can have
multiple processors. The processor object represents each processor as
an instance of the object.\0241\0% Total Processor Time is the average
percentage of time that all processors on the computer are executing
non-idle threads. This counter was designed as the primary indicator of
processor activity on multiprocessor computers. It is equal to the sum
of Process: % Processor Time for all processors, divided by the number
of processors. It is calculated by summing the time that all processors
spend executing the thread of the Idle process in each sample interval,
subtracting that value from 100%, and dividing the difference by the
number of processors on the computer. (Each processor has an Idle thread
which consumes cycles when no other threads are ready to run). For
example, on a multiprocessor computer, a value of 50% means that all
processors are busy for half of the sample interval, or that half of the
processors are busy for all of the sample interval. This counter
displays the average percentage of busy time observed during the sample
interval. It is calculated by monitoring the time the service was
inactive, and then subtracting that value from 100%.\0243\0% Total User
Time is the average percentage of non-idle time all processors spend in
user mode. It is the sum of Processor: % User Time for all processors on
the computer, divided by the number of processors. System: % Total User
Time and System: % Total Privileged Time sum to % Total Processor Time,
but not always to 100%. (User mode is a restricted processing mode
designed for applications, environment subsystems, and integral
subsystems. The alternative, privileged mode, is designed for operating
system components and allows direct access to hardware and all memory.
The operating system switches application threads to privileged mode to
access operating system services). This counter displays the average
busy time as a percentage of the sample time.\0245\0% Total Privileged
Time is the average percentage of non-idle time all processors spend in
privileged (kernel) mode. It is the sum of Processor: % Privileged Time
for all processors on the computer, divided by the number of processors.
System: % Total User Time and System: % Total Privileged Time sum to %
Total Processor Time, but not always to 100%. (Privileged mode is an
processing mode designed for operating system components which allows
direct access to hardware and all memory. The operating system switches
application threads to privileged mode to access operating system
services. The alternative, user mode, is a restricted processing mode
designed for applications and environment subsystems). This counter
displays the average busy time as a percentage of the sample
time.\0247\0Total Interrupts/sec is the combined rate of hardware
interrupts received and serviced by all processors on the computer It is
the sum of Processor: Interrupts/sec for all processors, and divided by
the number of processors, and is measured in numbers of interrupts. It
does not include DPCs, which are counted separately. This value is an
indirect indicator of the activity of devices that generate interrupts,
such as the system timer, the mouse, disk drivers, data communication
lines, network interface cards and other peripheral devices. These
devices normally interrupt the processor when they have completed a task
or require attention. Normal thread execution is suspended during
interrupts. Most system clocks interrupt the processor every 10
milliseconds, creating a background of interrupt activity. This counter
displays the difference between the values observed in the last two
samples, divided by the duration of the sample interval.\0249\0Processes
is the number of processes in the computer at the time of data
collection. This is an instantaneous count, not an average over the time
interval. Each process represents the running of a
program.\0251\0Threads is the number of threads in the computer at the
time of data collection. This is an instantaneous count, not an average
over the time interval. A thread is the basic executable entity that can
execute instructions in a processor.\0253\0Events is the number of
events in the computer at the time of data collection. This is an
instantaneous count, not an average over the time interval. An event is
used when two or more threads try to synchronize
execution.\0255\0Semaphores is the number of semaphores in the computer
at the time of data collection. This is an instantaneous count, not an
average over the time interval. Threads use semaphores to obtain
exclusive access to data structures that they share with other
threads.\0257\0Mutexes counts the number of mutexes in the computer at
the time of data collection. This is an instantaneous count, not an
average over the time interval. Mutexes are used by threads to assure
only one thread is executing a particular section of
code.\0259\0Sections is the number of sections in the computer at the
time of data collection. This is an instantaneous count, not an average
over the time interval. A section is a portion of virtual memory created
by a process for storing data. A process can share sections with other
processes.\0261\0The Object performance object consists of counters that
monitor logical objects in the system, such as processes, threads,
mutexes, and semaphores. This information can be used to detect the
unnecessary consumption of computer resources. Each object requires
memory to store basic information about the object.\0263\0The Redirector
performance object consists of counter that monitor network connections
originating at the local computer.\0265\0Bytes Received/sec is the rate
of bytes coming in to the Redirector from the network. It includes all
application data as well as network protocol information (such as packet
headers).\0267\0Packets Received/sec is the rate at which the Redirector
is receiving packets (also called SMBs or Server Message Blocks).
Network transmissions are divided into packets. The average number of
bytes received in a packet can be obtained by dividing Bytes
Received/sec by this counter. Some packets received might not contain
incoming data (for example an acknowledgment to a write made by the
Redirector would count as an incoming packet).\0269\0Read Bytes
Paging/sec is the rate at which the Redirector is attempting to read
bytes in response to page faults. Page faults are caused by loading of
modules (such as programs and libraries), by a miss in the Cache (see
Read Bytes Cache/sec), or by files directly mapped into the address
space of applications (a high-performance feature of Windows
NT).\0271\0Read Bytes Non-Paging/sec are those bytes read by the
Redirector in response to normal file requests by an application when
they are redirected to come from another computer. In addition to file
requests, this counter includes other methods of reading across the
network such as Named Pipes and Transactions. This counter does not
count network protocol information, just application data.\0273\0Read
Bytes Cache/sec is the rate at which applications are accessing the file
system cache by using the Redirector. Some of these data requests are
satisfied by retrieving the data from the cache. Requests that miss the
Cache cause a page fault (see Read Bytes Paging/sec).\0275\0Read Bytes
Network/sec is the rate at which applications are reading data across
the network. This occurs when data sought in the file system cache is
not found there and must be retrieved from the network. Dividing this
value by Bytes Received/sec indicates the proportion of application data
traveling across the network. (see Bytes Received/sec).\0277\0Bytes
Transmitted/sec is the rate at which bytes are leaving the Redirector to
the network. It includes all application data as well as network
protocol information (such as packet headers and the
like).\0279\0Packets Transmitted/sec is the rate at which the Redirector
is sending packets (also called SMBs or Server Message Blocks). Network
transmissions are divided into packets. The average number of bytes
transmitted in a packet can be obtained by dividing Bytes
Transmitted/sec by this counter.\0281\0Write Bytes Paging/sec is the
rate at which the Redirector is attempting to write bytes changed in the
pages being used by applications. The program data changed by modules
(such as programs and libraries) that were loaded over the network are
'paged out' when no longer needed. Other output pages come from the file
system cache (see Write Bytes Cache/sec).\0283\0Write Bytes
Non-Paging/sec is the rate at which bytes are written by the Redirector
in response to normal file outputs by an application when they are
redirected to another computer. In addition to file requests, this count
includes other methods of writing across the network, such as Named
Pipes and Transactions. This counter does not count network protocol
information, just application data.\0285\0Write Bytes Cache/sec is the
rate at which applications on your computer are writing to the file
system cache by using the Redirector. The data might not leave your
computer immediately; it can be retained in the cache for further
modification before being written to the network. This saves network
traffic. Each write of a byte into the cache is counted
here.\0287\0Write Bytes Network/sec is the rate at which applications
are writing data across the network. This occurs when the file system
cache is bypassed, such as for Named Pipes or Transactions, or when the
cache writes the bytes to disk to make room for other data. Dividing
this counter by Bytes Transmitted/sec will indicate the proportion of
application data being to the network (see Transmitted
Bytes/sec).\0289\0File Read Operations/sec is the rate at which
applications are asking the Redirector for data. Each call to a file
system or similar Application Program Interface (API) call counts as one
operation.\0291\0Read Operations Random/sec counts the rate at which, on
a file-by-file basis, reads are made that are not sequential. If a read
is made using a particular file handle, and then is followed by another
read that is not immediately the contiguous next byte, this counter is
incremented by one.\0293\0Read Packets/sec is the rate at which read
packets are being placed on the network. Each time a single packet is
sent with a request to read data remotely, this counter is incremented
by one.\0295\0Reads Large/sec is the rate at which reads over 2 times
the server's negotiated buffer size are made by applications. Too many
of these could place a strain on server resources. This counter is
incremented once for each read. It does not count packets.\0297\0Read
Packets Small/sec is the rate at which reads less than one-fourth of the
server's negotiated buffer size are made by applications. Too many of
these could indicate a waste of buffers on the server. This counter is
incremented once for each read. It does not count packets.\0299\0File
Write Operations/sec is the rate at which applications are sending data
to the Redirector. Each call to a file system or similar Application
Program Interface (API) call counts as one operation.\0301\0Write
Operations Random/sec is the rate at which, on a file-by-file basis,
writes are made that are not sequential. If a write is made using a
particular file handle, and then is followed by another write that is
not immediately the next contiguous byte, this counter is incremented by
one.\0303\0Write Packets/sec is the rate at which writes are being sent
to the network. Each time a single packet is sent with a request to
write remote data, this counter is incremented by one.\0305\0Writes
Large/sec is the rate at which writes are made by applications that are
over 2 times the server's negotiated buffer size. Too many of these
could place a strain on server resources. This counter is incremented
once for each write: it counts writes, not packets.\0307\0Write Packets
Small/sec is the rate at which writes are made by applications that are
less than one-fourth of the server's negotiated buffer size. Too many of
these could indicate a waste of buffers on the server. This counter is
incremented once for each write: it counts writes, not
packets.\0309\0Reads Denied/sec is the rate at which the server is
unable to accommodate requests for Raw Reads. When a read is much larger
than the server's negotiated buffer size, the Redirector requests a Raw
Read which, if granted, would permit the transfer of the data without
lots of protocol overhead on each packet. To accomplish this the server
must lock out other requests, so the request is denied if the server is
really busy.\0311\0Writes Denied/sec is the rate at which the server is
unable to accommodate requests for Raw Writes. When a write is much
larger than the server's negotiated buffer size, the Redirector requests
a Raw Write which, if granted, would permit the transfer of the data
without lots of protocol overhead on each packet. To accomplish this the
server must lock out other requests, so the request is denied if the
server is really busy.\0313\0Network Errors/sec is the rate at which
serious unexpected errors are occurring. Such errors generally indicate
that the Redirector and one or more Servers are having serious
communication difficulties. For example an SMB (Server Message Block)
protocol error is a Network Error. An entry is written to the System
Event Log and provide details.\0315\0Server Sessions counts the total
number of security objects the Redirector has managed. For example, a
logon to a server followed by a network access to the same server will
establish one connection, but two sessions.\0317\0Server Reconnects
counts the number of times your Redirector has had to reconnect to a
server in order to complete a new active request. You can be
disconnected by the Server if you remain inactive for too long. Locally
even if all your remote files are closed, the Redirector will keep your
connections intact for (nominally) ten minutes. Such inactive
connections are called Dormant Connections. Reconnecting is expensive in
time.\0319\0Connects Core counts the number of connections you have to
servers running the original MS-Net SMB protocol, including MS-Net
itself and Xenix and VAX's.\0321\0Connects LAN Manager 2.0 counts
connections to LAN Manager 2.0 servers, including LMX
servers.\0323\0Connects LAN Manager 2.1 counts connections to LAN
Manager 2.1 servers, including LMX servers.\0325\0Connects Windows NT
counts the connections to Windows 2000 or earlier
computers.\0327\0Server Disconnects counts the number of times a Server
has disconnected your Redirector. See also Server
Reconnects.\0329\0Server Sessions Hung counts the number of active
sessions that are timed out and unable to proceed due to a lack of
response from the remote server.\0331\0The Server performance object
consists of counters that measure communication between the local
computer and the network.\0333\0The number of bytes the server has
received from the network. Indicates how busy the server is.\0335\0The
number of bytes the server has sent on the network. Indicates how busy
the server is.\0337\0Thread Wait Reason is only applicable when the
thread is in the Wait state (see Thread State). It is 0 or 7 when the
thread is waiting for the Executive, 1 or 8 for a Free Page, 2 or 9 for
a Page In, 3 or 10 for a Pool Allocation, 4 or 11 for an Execution
Delay, 5 or 12 for a Suspended condition, 6 or 13 for a User Request, 14
for an Event Pair High, 15 for an Event Pair Low, 16 for an LPC Receive,
17 for an LPC Reply, 18 for Virtual Memory, 19 for a Page Out; 20 and
higher are not assigned at the time of this writing. Event Pairs are
used to communicate with protected subsystems (see Context
Switches).\0339\0% DPC Time is the percentage of time that the processor
spent receiving and servicing deferred procedure calls (DPCs) during the
sample interval. DPCs are interrupts that run at a lower priority than
standard interrupts. % DPC Time is a component of % Privileged Time
because DPCs are executed in privileged mode. They are counted
separately and are not a component of the interrupt counters. This
counter displays the average busy time as a percentage of the sample
time.\0341\0The number of sessions that have been closed due to their
idle time exceeding the AutoDisconnect parameter for the server. Shows
whether the AutoDisconnect setting is helping to conserve
resources.\0343\0The number of sessions that have been closed due to
unexpected error conditions or sessions that have reached the
autodisconnect timeout and have been disconnected normally. The
autodisconnect timeout value represents the number of seconds that idle
connections with no session attached to have before being disconnected
automatically by a server. The default value is 30 seconds. This counter
increments as a result of normal server operation, not as an indication
of network problems or unexpected error condition.\0345\0The number of
sessions that have terminated normally. Useful in interpreting the
Sessions Times Out and Sessions Errored Out statistics--allows
percentage calculations.\0347\0The number of sessions that have been
forced to logoff. Can indicate how many sessions were forced to logoff
due to logon time constraints.\0349\0The number of failed logon attempts
to the server. Can indicate whether password guessing programs are being
used to crack the security on the server.\0351\0The number of times
opens on behalf of clients have failed with STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED. Can
indicate whether somebody is randomly attempting to access files in
hopes of getting at something that was not properly protected.\0353\0The
number of times accesses to files opened successfully were denied. Can
indicate attempts to access files without proper access
authorization.\0355\0The number of times an internal Server Error was
detected. Unexpected errors usually indicate a problem with the
Server.\0357\0The number of times the server has rejected blocking SMBs
due to insufficient count of free work items. Indicates whether the
MaxWorkItem or MinFreeWorkItems server parameters might need to be
adjusted.\0359\0The number of times STATUS_DATA_NOT_ACCEPTED was
returned at receive indication time. This occurs when no work item is
available or can be allocated to service the incoming request. Indicates
whether the InitWorkItems or MaxWorkItems parameters might need to be
adjusted.\0361\0The number of successful open attempts performed by the
server of behalf of clients. Useful in determining the amount of file
I/O, determining overhead for path-based operations, and for determining
the effectiveness of open locks.\0363\0The number of files currently
opened in the server. Indicates current server activity.\0365\0The
number of sessions currently active in the server. Indicates current
server activity.\0367\0The number of searches for files currently active
in the server. Indicates current server activity.\0369\0The number of

from nonpaged pool have failed. Indicates that the computer's physical
memory is too small.\0373\0The maximum number of bytes of nonpaged pool
the server has had in use at any one point. Indicates how much physical
memory the computer should have.\0375\0The number of bytes of pageable
computer memory the server is currently using. Can help in determining
good values for the MaxPagedMemoryUsage parameter.\0377\0The number of
times allocations from paged pool have failed. Indicates that the
computer's physical memory or paging file are too small.\0379\0The
maximum number of bytes of paged pool the server has had allocated.

mailslot messages that could not be received due to transport
failures.\0387\0Mailslot Writes Failed is the total number of mailslot
messages that have been successfully received, but that could not be
written to the mailslot.\0389\0Bytes Total/sec is the rate the
Redirector is processing data bytes. This includes all application and
file data in addition to protocol information such as packet
headers.\0391\0File Data Operations/sec is the rate at which the
Redirector is processing data operations. One operation should include
many bytes, since each operation has overhead. The efficiency of this
path can be determined by dividing the Bytes/sec by this counter to
obtain the average number of bytes transferred per
operation.\0393\0Current Commands counter indicates the number of
pending commands from the local computer to all destination servers. If
the Current Commands counter shows a high number and the local computer
is idle, this may indicate a network-related problem or a redirector
bottleneck on the local computer.\0395\0The number of bytes the server
has sent to and received from the network. This value provides an
overall indication of how busy the server is.\0397\0% Interrupt Time is
the time the processor spends receiving and servicing hardware
interrupts during sample intervals. This value is an indirect indicator
of the activity of devices that generate interrupts, such as the system
clock, the mouse, disk drivers, data communication lines, network
interface cards and other peripheral devices. These devices normally
interrupt the processor when they have completed a task or require
attention. Normal thread execution is suspended during interrupts. Most
system clocks interrupt the processor every 10 milliseconds, creating a
background of interrupt activity. suspends normal thread execution
during interrupts. This counter displays the average busy time as a
percentage of the sample time.\0399\0The NWLink NetBIOS performance
object consists of counters that monitor IPX transport rates and
connections.\0401\0Packets/sec is the rate the Redirector is processing
data packets. One packet includes (hopefully) many bytes. We say
hopefully here because each packet has protocol overhead. You can
determine the efficiency of this path by dividing the Bytes/sec by this
counter to determine the average number of bytes transferred/packet. You
can also divide this counter by Operations/sec to determine the average
number of packets per operation, another measure of
efficiency.\0405\0Context Blocks Queued per second is the rate at which

We are given a registry key and its values. The key is:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows
NT\CurrentVersion\Perflib\CurrentLanguage

Under this key, there are two values: "Counter" and "Help", both of type
REG_MULTI_SZ.

The "Counter" value contains a list of strings that map counter indices
to counter names.
The "Help" value contains a list of strings that map counter indices to
help text for the counters.

The data is provided as a long string of numbers and names (or help
text) separated by nulls and backslashes.

We are to parse this data and provide a mapping from counter index to
counter name and counter index to help text.

However, note that the data for "Counter" and "Help" are provided in the
same format:
index1\0name1\0index2\0name2\0 ...

But note that the example provided in the question is a long string that
starts with:

WHAT IS THAT

[]

[]

[]

Thought for 7 seconds

Hmm, the user's query is extremely vague—just three words with no
context. They might be pointing at something, reacting to a sudden
sight, or referring to a previous message. Since there's no specific
target, I need to cover all possible interpretations without assuming
anything.

First, I should address the literal meaning: "what is that" usually asks
for identification. But since I don't know what "that" is, I'll list
common scenarios—objects, concepts, slang, or tech issues. A structured
breakdown with examples would help the user refine their question.

Then, I should consider the urgency. The phrasing feels abrupt, maybe
they're confused or startled. I'll prompt them to specify while staying
friendly and open-ended. No jargon, just clear categories and a nudge to
provide more details.

Haha, that's a wonderfully broad and classic question! "What is that?"
can be about anything.

To give you a useful answer, I need a little more context. What are you
looking at or thinking about?

To get started, here are some common things people ask "What is that?"
about:

-   An Object: Are you looking at a strange tool, an unusual piece of
    art, or something you've never seen before?

    -   You could: Describe it to me or, even better, upload a picture
        of it!

-   A Concept: Is it a word, a philosophical idea, or a scientific term
    you don't understand?

    -   For example: "What is blockchain?" or "What is existentialism?"

-   A Sound: Are you hearing a noise you can't identify (like a bird
    call, a machine sound, or a snippet of music)?

    -   You could: Describe the sound or hum the tune!

-   A Trend or Meme: Did you see something confusing online or in pop
    culture?

    -   For example: "What is that new dance everyone is doing on
        TikTok?"

-   A Feeling/Sensation: Are you trying to identify a physical or
    emotional feeling?

    -   For example: "What is that feeling of nostalgia for a time you
        never experienced?" (That's called anemoia!).

So, tell me more! Point me in the right direction.
