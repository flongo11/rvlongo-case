*TO: Crown Attorney Zack Baniston* *FROM: Francesco Longo
(Self-Represented)*

*RE: MANDATORY DISCLOSURE & FUNDAMENTAL EVIDENTIARY IMPOSSIBILITIES*

Dear Crown Attorney Baniston,

As confirmed in today's judicial case management with His Honour, I am now
self-represented and require immediate disclosure compliance under R. v.
Stinchcombe. My review of the evidence reveals fundamental impossibilities
that require your immediate attention.

*MANDATORY DISCLOSURE DEMANDS UNDER R. v. STINCHCOMBE:*

*IMMEDIATE PRODUCTION REQUIRED (Prior to July 7th):*

*1. COMPLETE SURVEILLANCE PACKAGE:*

   - Full 24-48 hour surveillance recordings from motion-activated system
   - All audio recordings from surveillance system for relevant period
   - Technical specifications and operation manual for surveillance
   equipment
   - Metadata showing recording times, deletions, or gaps in coverage
   - Expert analysis of surveillance system capabilities and operation

*2. COMPLETE POLICE INVESTIGATION FILE:*

   - All police reports, notes, and communications
   - Officer qualifications and training records for damage assessment
   - All photographs taken at scene with timestamps
   - Evidence collection logs and chain of custody documents
   - Dispatch logs showing officer location when 911 call received
   - All radio communications related to incident

*3. 911 CALL COMPLETE PACKAGE:*

   - Full unedited 911 call recording
   - Emergency classification and dispatch protocols followed
   - Dispatcher notes and emergency assessment
   - Response time analysis and justification
   - Comparison to standard response times for similar calls

*4. HOMEOWNER STATEMENTS AND EVIDENCE:*

   - All written and recorded statements by both homeowners
   - Financial records showing debt to me ($22,000+)
   - All communications between homeowners and police
   - Email communications with me (including day-before satisfaction email)
   - Any receipts or estimates for claimed damages or repairs

*5. EXPERT EVIDENCE PACKAGE:*

   - Professional damage assessment (if any conducted)
   - Expert analysis of concrete curing times and properties
   - Pool system operation expert analysis
   - Construction damage evaluation by qualified contractor
   - Scientific analysis of brown residue (mud vs. concrete)

*6. CROWN PROSECUTION FILE:*

   - All internal Crown communications about case
   - Case assessment and screening documentation
   - Legal research supporting $5,000+ charge with $300 evidence
   - Constitutional compliance review (if conducted)
   - Public interest assessment documentation

*7. MISSING/NON-EXISTENT EVIDENCE EXPLANATION:*

   - Written explanation for including pool liner in charges (none
   installed)
   - Documentation of pool equipment allegedly damaged (none existed)
   - Investigation showing equipment purchase/installation (never occurred)
   - Expert verification of equipment damage claims

*FUNDAMENTAL LEGAL IMPOSSIBILITIES REQUIRING EXPLANATION:*

*1. ZERO ACTUAL DAMAGE:* The $300 was NOT damage - it was homeowner's
voluntary service call. Plumber found no concrete, no blockage, no damage.
How do you prove "actual damage exceeding $5,000" with zero actual damage
proven?

*2. PHYSICAL IMPOSSIBILITY OF JETS CLAIM:* Homeowner testified under oath
that "concrete is still coming through jets as I speak." This is physically
impossible because:

   - All pool water passes through filtration before reaching jets
   - Filtration systems prevent debris larger than microscopic particles
   - If concrete entered system, filter would be destroyed
   - No evidence of filtration system damage provided
   - Even leaves and bugs cannot pass through proper filtration

*3. SCIENTIFIC IMPOSSIBILITY OF TIMING:* Officer claimed "hardened
concrete" at scene within 10 minutes. Scientific reality:

   - Concrete requires minimum 45 minutes for initial set
   - 10-minute hardening is scientifically impossible
   - Photos show brown residue (mud), not gray concrete
   - No hardened concrete specimens recovered

*4. EQUIPMENT FRAUD:* Charges reference liner and equipment damage when:

   - No pool liner was installed (visible in all photographs)
   - No functional pool equipment existed on property
   - Pool was non-operational without liner
   - Cannot damage equipment that doesn't exist
   - Liner and equipment were homeowner's responsibility to purchase (never
   bought)

*5. FRAUDULENT POLICE REPORT CONTENTS:*

   - Why is pool liner referenced in police report when none was installed?
   - Why is pool equipment damage claimed when no equipment existed on
   property?
   - Why are filtration system damages claimed when no system was installed?
   - Evidence that these items were added solely to inflate damage claims

*6. MATHEMATICAL IMPOSSIBILITY:* How do you prove damage "exceeding $5,000"
with:

   - Zero actual damage proven
   - Only voluntary $300 service call (not damage)
   - No repairs performed or receipts provided
   - No professional assessment obtained

*SPECIFIC QUESTIONS REQUIRING ANSWERS:*

*1. SURVEILLANCE EVIDENCE:* Why was only 3 minutes of surveillance provided
when the system operates 24/7? Where is the audio recording of police
arriving and speaking with homeowners 10+ minutes after I left?

*2. POLICE RESPONSE:* How does officer arrive in 10 minutes to a
"contractor collecting tools" call unless personal relationship exists? If
this was reported as emergency destruction, why only one officer responded?

*3. EXPERT EVIDENCE:* What expert evidence supports proceeding with
mischief over $5,000 when NO ACTUAL DAMAGE occurred - only a $300 service
call the homeowner voluntarily chose to make?

*4. EQUIPMENT INVESTIGATION:* What investigation verified the existence of
liner and equipment before including them in criminal charges? Why are
items included that had nothing to do with the alleged incident and didn't
exist on the property?

*5. OFFICER QUALIFICATIONS:* What qualifies the arresting officer to assess
construction damage when no professional assessment was obtained?

*6. HOMEOWNER CREDIBILITY:* How can you rely on homeowner testimony when
financial motive ($22,000+ debt avoidance) and contradictory statements are
evident?

*FINANCIAL RETALIATION EVIDENCE:* Email from homeowner day before
termination: "you did a great job, nobody said you're a bad guy"
Termination email sent day after billing for extra concrete work Evidence
of $22,000+ owed for completed work at 95% job completion

*EXPERT WITNESS REQUIREMENTS:*

*MY POTENTIAL EXPERT WITNESSES:*

   - Licensed contractor for damage assessment
   - Concrete specialist for curing time analysis
   - Pool system engineer for filtration impossibility
   - Surveillance system expert for evidence tampering analysis
   - Financial expert for retaliation motive analysis

*CROWN'S REQUIRED EXPERT WITNESSES:*

   - Qualified expert to justify $5,000+ damage assessment
   - Scientific expert to explain 10-minute concrete hardening
   - Pool system expert to explain concrete flowing through jets
   - Construction expert to verify equipment damage claims

*ADDITIONAL WITNESSES FOR TRIAL:*

*DEFENSE WITNESSES:*

   - Plumber who found no concrete in lines ($300 service call)
   - Construction experts to testify about impossibilities
   - Character witnesses regarding my work quality
   - Immigration lawyer regarding damages from false charges

*CROWN WITNESSES TO BE SUBPOENAED:*

   - Both homeowners (for cross-examination on perjury)
   - Arresting police officer (qualifications and assessment)
   - Any Crown experts (if they exist)
   - 911 dispatcher (emergency classification)

*CONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATIONS:*

My filed Charter applications document systematic violations:

   - Section 7: Fair trial denied through missing evidence and impossible
   charges
   - Section 9: Arbitrary detention without reasonable grounds
   - Section 10(a): Not informed of true reasons for detention

*PROSECUTORIAL STANDARDS REVIEW:*

Under Ontario Crown Manual requirements:

   - "Reasonable prospect of conviction" standard not met
   - Independent assessment of evidence not conducted
   - Public interest test failed (private debt collection)
   - Professional standards for case screening violated

*CONDITIONAL WITHDRAWAL TERMS:*

While the evidence overwhelming supports withdrawal of charges, I will only
accept withdrawal under the following conditions:

*1. JUDICIAL DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED:*

   - Written judicial findings documenting all prosecutorial failures
   - Official court record of constitutional violations
   - Judicial criticism of investigation standards
   - Court-ordered referral for criminal investigation of homeowners

*2. COURT APPEARANCE MANDATORY:*

   - July 7th hearing must proceed for official record
   - You must acknowledge failures on court record
   - Homeowners must appear for immediate arrest on perjury charges
   - Complete judicial review of systematic failures

*3. PROSECUTORIAL ACCOUNTABILITY:*

   - Written admission of failure to meet professional standards
   - Acknowledgment of proceeding without reasonable prospect of conviction
   - Official documentation of evidence not obtained
   - Signed statement of due diligence failures

*WITHOUT THESE CONDITIONS, I INSIST ON FULL TRIAL* to ensure complete
documentation of systematic failures for civil proceedings and public
accountability.

*IMMEDIATE REQUESTS:*

*1. MEETING REQUEST:* I am available to meet immediately to review these
fundamental evidentiary failures and discuss:

   - Evidence gaps and impossibilities
   - Expert witness requirements
   - Trial scheduling given disclosure timeline
   - Potential case resolution given fundamental failures

*2. INVESTIGATION REFERRAL:* The systematic false statements and evidence
tampering warrant criminal investigation of:

   - Homeowners for perjury, public mischief, and conspiracy
   - Police officer for false reporting and potential conspiracy
   - Examination of personal relationships affecting investigation

*DISCLOSURE TIMELINE:*

   - *Immediate:* All existing evidence and files
   - *Within 48 hours:* Expert assessments and missing evidence explanations
   - *Prior to July 7th:* Complete package as required by Stinchcombe

*DEADLINE CONFIRMATION:* Please confirm by return email:

   - Timeline for complete disclosure production
   - Meeting availability this week
   - Crown's expert witness list and qualifications
   - Response to fundamental evidentiary impossibilities raised

*DISCLOSURE NON-COMPLIANCE CONSEQUENCES:* Failure to provide complete
disclosure will result in:

   - Charter application for disclosure violations
   - Adjournment application for inadequate preparation time
   - Exclusion of evidence applications under s.24(2)
   - Stay of proceedings for abuse of process

*LEGAL CONCLUSION:*

This prosecution cannot proceed when:

   - No actual damage occurred (only voluntary service call)
   - Physical claims violate basic scientific principles
   - Timeline claims are scientifically impossible
   - Equipment damage claims reference non-existent items
   - Financial motive for false accusations is documented
   - Police report fraudulently includes non-existent items

Proceeding with charges that are mathematically, physically, and
scientifically impossible violates prosecutorial ethics and constitutional
principles.

*I will not accept private withdrawal without judicial findings and
prosecutorial accountability.*
